    "abstract": "<p>    There are tons of great MVC web frameworks out in the wild, for most major compiled    and dynamic languages. They're great tools to get projects prototyped and quickly    into production. The Ambition MVC framework is a hobby that turned into a reasonable    web framework. Written using Vala, the Ambition framework allows a developer or    team of developers to create web applications or RESTful services using a static-typed    object oriented language without relying on a VM or a garbage collection cycle.    Plus, being compiled, it allows cloud deployment to be easy and inexpensive, as    memory and CPU requirements can be a fraction of PHP, Ruby, Python, or Perl sites.    While it's not \"officially\" released, it's available on GitHub, and being actively    developed. Patches, help, and end users are very welcome, and I'd like to show you    more.</p>",

After many years    in purgatory, JavaScript is now blessed and officially supported by Apple for usage    in native iOS apps. In this talk, we'll focus on what developers need to know to    take advantage of JavaScriptCore bindings in iOS 7. We will also explore where this    new technology fits in alongside existing JavaScript solutions for mobile development,    like Appcelerator's Titanium and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap). To demonstrate how this    new framework might be used, we will script a simple game using SpriteKit, the new    built-in 2D game framework in iOS 7. There are many exciting possible applications    of this technology, and I hope the JavaScript community takes full advantage of    them.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    Angular.JS from Google introduces a radically different way to build things for    the web with HTML and JavaScript. In this talk, we'll take a look at the basic and    most useful features of Angular as we build some simple apps and widgets we're already    familiar with using new techniques. We'll look at Angular's support for data binding,    services, directives, and testing. And we'll also talk about where Angular isn't    a good fit.</p>",

In this presentation I will demonstrate how to develop your entire UI with client    side javascript, css, and html, using WebAPI for back end database interaction and    middle tier logic. This presentation uses a combination of javascript libraries,    including JQuery, Knockout, BreezeJS, History.JS, and Q-Js. These libraries make    writing SPA applications easier than ever, with client side data binding and observable    javascript objects among other features.
