No longer having to worry about deleting pointers,    leaking memory, having enough space available, it is all taken care of for you by    the Garbage Collector. But what happens when a large amount of your data is large    enough that it needs to go into the large object heap. How do you make sure that    you are not fragmenting it so much that the next request to get data has space?    How do you make sure that these large pieces of data are not mapped into the address    space all the time, taking up valuable space in the 2GB limit?</p><p>    This presentation will focus on some specific functionality that Thomson-West implemented    to handle large legal documents (MB of XML), that can be slow to retrieve via soap    in a manner that kept them out of the large object heap. Discussion will center    on implementing a soap extension that generically parses a soap response to pull    out the large strings, pushing them to the Virtual Heap, instead of placing them    on the large object heap.</p>",

It allows you to develop rich, fine-grained domain models that leverage the    standard object-oriented idioms of inheritance, polymorphism, association, and composition    without the challenges associated with handling the low-level persistence details.    This session will explore the framework's core features by providing examples of    how to effectively implement Hibernate in your applications.</p>",

This presentation will help you get off to a great start. SharePoint    is a lot bigger than documents and lists and this presentation will be an introduction    to developing against it. We'll cover the object model by creating a web part, using    the web services from a Windows form app and how to use RPC to perform actions that    the web services don.t support. We'll also discuss how to take advantage of the    relationship between SharePoint and ASP.net.</p>",

This talk will    examine the course of events that led up to the current love affair with richer    client applications. We'll talk examine the technologies that power an Ajax application    and discuss how to work with them - and then we'll examine a number of frameworks    that will do much of the heavy lifting for us!</p><p>    Once we understand the techniques of Ajax, we'll touch on where (and where not)    it's appropriate for your application finishing off with some common gotchas.</p>",

    "authorBio": "    Nathaniel T. Schutta is a senior software engineer in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota    with extensive experience developing Java Enterprise Edition–based Web applications.    He graduated from St. John's University (MN) with a degree in Computer Science and    has a master's of science degree in software engineering from the University of    Minnesota. For the last several years, he has focused on user interface design.    A long-time member of the Association for Computing Machinery's Computer-Human Interaction    Special Interest Group, Nathaniel believes that if the user can't figure out your    application, then you've done something wrong. Along with his user interface work,    Nathaniel is the cocreator of the open-source Taconite framework, has contributed    to two corporate Java frameworks, has developed training material, and has led several    study groups. During the brief moments of warm weather found in his home state of    Minnesota, he spends as much time on the golf course as his wife will tolerate.    He's currently exploring Ruby, Rails, and (after recently making the switch) Mac    OS X. Nathaniel is the coauthor of the bestselling book, Foundations of Ajax.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li><a href=\"http://www.ntschutta.com/jat/\">Personal Blog</a></li></ul>",
