    "abstract": "<p>    Most of us developers have that bug, you know the one, the itch, the drive to create,    to start something. But, the inertia of the couch is sometimes just too much to    overcome. We've got the skill and the ideas, but sometimes we just need a kick.    One terrific kick is Startup Weekend (Nov 19-21, go sign up ,we'll wait). In this    session Andy Pickett describes how Startup Weekend provided that launch pad and    just enough boost for his teammates to get something real off the ground. That something    is QONQR, the GeoSocial Game of World Domination! This session will be 1 part code,    1 part business, 1 part game theory, and 100% awesome. We'll walk through the process    of the startup from pitch to design to alpha to beta and beyond. It will include    a tour through the (3 week old) codebase that is QONQR (including a Mobile Web front    end using ASP.Net MVC 2 and jQuery, a Tactical Command Center written in Silverlight,    and SQL Server back end). Hopefully this will just be a fun, maybe inspiring conversation    about getting something started. There will be absolutely no best practices or patterns    displayed, as well as no legally binding business advice of any kind, this much    we promise you.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    To successfully create a ubiquitous data access technology that can work with any    data source, Microsoft needed to build a framework that anyone can work with to    introduce their own providers. This ubiquitous data access technology is called    Language Integrated Query (LINQ). Today, Microsoft ships several LINQ providers    out-of-the-box: LINQ to Objects, LINQ to DataSet, LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Entities,    LINQ to XML, and LINQ to Data Services. There are also many 3rd party LINQ providers    for various data sources, made possible by reusable .NET Framework types. LINQ to    Twitter is one such 3rd party provider, which is the example used in this presentation.    You'll learn how LINQ to Twitter is implemented with various interfaces and patterns    to expose the common LINQ development experience you've grown accustomed to with    other providers. The main difference is that the data source is Twitter. Since LINQ    to Twitter is open source, you also have a working example and will gain insight    into how to create your own LINQ provider, should you ever have a need to do so.    Additionally, by looking inside of the process used to build a LINQ provider, you'll    gain a deeper understanding of how LINQ works across all providers.</p>",

In this    session I'll talk about which things are easiest to share, and which are hardest.    I'll also show you some recommended approaches on how to structure your project,    as well as a comparison of the different ways by which you can share code and xaml.    I'll cover topics such as assembly portability, code sharing using linked files,    usercontrol encapsulation and abstraction, and even loading xaml at runtime after    tinkering with the source via code.</p>",

Q: But isn't it true that using Rails    is extremely simple to use even if I haven't done Ruby before? A: Yes. Q: So Rails    is what I should you use build Ruby web applications? A: Maybe. If Rails is a hammer,    it's my goal to show you that your next project may not need nails. I hope to show    you the benefits of how using simple Ruby can put you on the path to better application    design. I'll also show you a few tools of the Rubyist's trade that enable you to    build a modular web application from emerging needs of your problem space. In the    end we'll come full circle and I'll show you how the Rails philosophy is shifting    in the direction of modular design and how we can leverage all of our knowledge    with Rails to build powerful Ruby applications for the web.</p>",

We'll analyze all three of these aspects in some detail from existing underlying    object models to extending parts of the framework to support varying consumer needs.    We'll identify and highlight the inner workings of Windows Communication Foundation    to get the most of what the framework has to offer.</p>",

We'll cover the ins, outs, and \"gotchas\" of the API that detects    an internet connection as well as what it means to run \"out of browser\".
