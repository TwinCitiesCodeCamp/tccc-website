    "abstract": "<p>    For the past year I've been working in an environment with over 30 agile development teams all working simultaneously on the same product/platform. This has been a new experience for me as I am used to working in environments where only a couple agile teams are working together at any given time (and usually those teams are pioneering the methodology at that company, working along side teams developing software using a waterfall methodology.) Working with so many different agile teams simultaneously has been a very enlightening experience. Most of the usual battles new agile teams face have been fought and won, and new and interesting challenges arise. Come to this session to learn how 30 team, with over 300 repos, all work together on the same product and release functionality independently of each other.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    Web developers are told that hacks like resource inlining, domain sharding, and image spriting are best practices for improving website performance. But these hacks are just to work around the limitations of an aging protocol. Although HTTP/1.1 has served the world fairly well for the past 15 years, changes to the way in which we use the Internet have pushed this protocol beyond what it was designed to do. The HTTP/2 specification addresses many of these limitations, while also making better use of network resources. Topics to be discussed are HPACK header compression, multiplexing, server push, and security considerations. Basic knowledge of TCP and HTTP/1.1 is recommended.</p>",

    "title": "Structured Logging with Serilog on .NET",
    "abstract": "<p>    Logging is an essential part of an application but for too long we've been stuck with log entries that are a string and a property bag which can be difficult to analyze and correlate with other log entries. It is too hard to create meaningful logs for complex distributed systems when we are stuck using old logging frameworks. The Serilog library for the .NET framework and its structured or semantic logs allow us to add more context to our logs, more easily correlate logs across systems and greatly ease our querying and exploration of errors based on events in the system and other log entries. Serilog is easy to integrate into existing applications and can help you provide the rich data that you are looking for at development time in and in production by abstracting your logging sinks away from how you create your messages. It has a clean and simple API and a healthy ecosystem of sinks for your application to log to so you'll still be able to meet your companies standards and help improve upon them. Let your logs make you happy for once.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    In this talk I give an overview of several cutting-edge web development technologies. Rather than being general purpose programming languages, they focus solely on the task of developing for the web. These languages use DSLs to simplify the common tasks of writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interacting with the database. Also differing from many dynamic language web stacks, these languages employ static type systems which can catch many common errors early in the development cycle; saving on a lot of debugging time.</p><p>    The frameworks that I'll cover are: Opa, Ur/Web, and Elm. The talk will also cover some functional programming techniques that are in common use in the frameworks.</p><p>    I'll present several reasons why I think that web development is tending towards these sorts of technologies. Even if you don't find yourself using one of these in particular, you may well end up using the concepts that they contain.</p>",
