Turn your imagination into a Print &amp; Play card game using only a modern web browser, color printer and text editor.</p><p>    This session will use the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image format and JavaScript programming language to make a deck of cards for a simple game. Creating a few cards in graphics software like Inkscape is one thing, but what about 50 or 100 cards? What happens when you need to update them all? That’s the value of generating your SVG using JavaScript.</p><p>    We will start with a blank screen, adding color and graphics elements like lines, shapes, text and images. Learn about container elements and defining content for re-use. Understand how units in the SVG coordinate system can transform our on-screen creation into an 8.5 by 11 inch printed page (or PDF). SVG examples will be both in their native XML format and created from JavaScript using Snap.svg, an open source library from Adobe designed for modern web browsers.</p><p>    You will leave this session with a basic knowledge of SVG concepts, how to programmatically generate SVG using JavaScript, and how to make your SVG creation printer friendly.</p>",

Is any of it really worth it?</p><p>    During this talk I’ll show you how to write unit tests for Angular controllers, directives, services, along with browser components such as setTimeout and making HTTP calls. I’ll be writing my tests in Jasmine, and continuously running them in Karma. Then we will wrap up by writing one end-to-end test using Protractor.</p>",

The lack of quality is approaching crisis: we're losing users, losing customers, and losing credibility.</p><p>    Let's write better JavaScript. Let's find and debug our errors. The first step is to understand them.  We'll discuss JavaScript Error object in detail: How to use errors, how to catch them, and how to understand them. The asynchronous capabilities of JavaScript pose challenges to error handling that confuse many developers, so let's talk about some techniques to deal with errors across asynchronous boundaries. I'll also share some tips to improve the maintenance of your JavaScript applications.</p><p>    Let's fix our bugs!</p>",

They don't notice how often they mutter \"..how'd he implement that..\" or \"..where's that method that does X?\"  They don't notice that the search tool they use to answer these questions is from the 1960s. They don't even seem to notice that 90% of these type of searches fail! Fortunately, a developer turned researcher did notice, and has dedicated the better part of the last decade to eliminating this quiet productivity-killer.</p><p>    In this talk, I'll use both video examples and a massive repository of real developer activity data to prove that the typically-used regex searches waste a significant part of your day.  Yet this talk won't dwell on the past; it focuses squarely on a better search future. I'll provide a tour of Visual Studio's many built in searches, demonstrate two search tools available as extensions, and provide guidelines for better searching. By attending this talk you will become a more effective searcher, a skill that is surprisingly fundamental to software development, and I estimate you can eliminate 10-30% waste from an average sprint.</p>",

Recent studies on consumer spending for the 2013 holiday season demonstrate that much mobile commerce occurs on tablets. And as a productivity device, a tablet can be much more useful than a phone-sized device.</p><p>    But is designing and developing for tablets too difficult? Are there reasonable ways of cutting costs when developing tablet apps? How much visual design and code reuse is there in “universal” apps that run on phones and tablets? How different is a tablet from a laptop, and how different is it from a phone? All this and more will be discussed as we cover one of the leading trends for mobility in 2014.</p>",

By utilizing the Read Committed Snapshot database option or the Snapshot Isolation level within SQL Server, you can dramatically increase concurrency for your database applications.  After a high level overview of SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control within SQL Server. We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate. Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!</p>",
