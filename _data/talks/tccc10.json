    "abstract": "<p>    A year ago, I hopped on the mobile/smartphone band wagon, by picking up a Motorola    Droid. The original/milestone Droid phone from Motorola. I've been picking up learning    about \"mobile\" development and what it means to business and technologist in my    limited time, juggling multiple projects. The first thing you are faced, when you    want to explore mobile development, is what platform do you want to target? Apple/IOS,    Android, Blackberry, WebOS. As a systems integrator, with a number of technologies    under my belt, the question was how to you reach more than one platform. What I    discovered, is the web based frameworks and html5 are starting to emerge. Yes, these    frameworks are still a little on the bleeding edge of things, but isn't that what    all the fun is about? Get a peek into some of the emerging frameworks in this area.    These frameworks include jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Titanium, SproutCore, PhoneGap,    Rhodes are a few of the leading/bleeding frameworks that let you target multiple    platforms. This won't be a deep dive, but will be a mid-level overview of some of    these frameworks and my journey.</p>",

Fortunately, WCF is easily embraced when theres    an overall understanding of how the capabilities are organized. In this presentation    we'll first cover the capabilities of WCF and how they align to currently well known    integration strategies. Next, we'll consider some common challenges you'll encounter    when developing enterprise applications and systems with WCF.

    "title": "Welcome to NodeJS",
    "abstract": "<p>    NodeJS is a Server Side JavaScript (SSJS) implementation built off the Google Chrome    V8 JavaScript engine. It is grown considerably in popularity since its initial public    release a little over a year ago. Some have called 2011, the \"Year of Server Side    JavaScript.\" Why? Is it just a fad? What does it offer different from other server    side languages and frameworks? What makes it stand out? In this talk, we will be    discussing the answers to those questions as we look at design philosophy behind    NodeJS. We will also look into its implementation and some demo applications. The    goal is for you to come away with a clear understanding of what NodeJS is, what    problems it tries to solve, and how it could be used in your application stack.</p>",
