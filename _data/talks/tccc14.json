    "title": "9 Tips for a clean BackboneJS App",
    "abstract": "<p>    This presentation seeks to eliminate that spaghettified, unmaintainable, untestable    mess that JavaScript is so famous for producing and turn it into something beautiful.    Developed after working on large teams with devs unfamiliar with JavaScript (not    to mention Backbone) and yet tasked to create with it, I will walk through the 9    tips that I've found in practice will make your BackboneJS implementation easily    maintained, easier to read, run better, and will allow you to effortlessly write    those ever-so-important unit tests. Heavy on code samples, best practices, anti    patterns, gotchyas, and random insights, this presentation is meant to serve as    a reference point for creating a beautiful Backbone implementation for apps of any    size and reduce the learning curve of BackboneJS. Prior experience working with    Backbone is recommended, but not strictly necessary.</p>",

I’m not going to pretend that there aren’t    lots of frameworks out there to get the job done but something about Durandal.js    feels different – it’s simple, it runs on Knockout.js for MVVM goodness and importantly    you don’t have to write much code! FluentKnockoutHelpers builds on the power of    Knockout by using .NET and the Razor view engine to create ‘ASP.NET MVC like’ statically    typed helpers for use with Knockout. Utilize static typing, intellisense and the    compiler you already have in .NET to make Knockout development easier! In this presentation    expect to learn some pros and cons of SPAs including reasons to create a SPA in    the first place. After that we’ll dive right into the code of a non-trivial SPA    utilizing Durandal.js, Knockout.js, Require.js, Razor and WebAPI.</p>",

In this session, we'll go    over multiple issues with using Web API \"in the real world\" including debugging,    IOC, custom routing, error handling, working with the client-side, versioning, anti-XSS    protection, async actions, authorization/authentication, and working with multiple    front-ends (Windows 8 and the web). This session is intended for those who are already    familiar with Web API, but everyone is welcome. Kamran will be using his own project    as an example, for better or worse, and would love for attendees to bring their    own experiences to the discussion. Code will be slung, questions will be raised,    and knowledge will be shared.</p>",

Writing the documentation    before writing the code, can lead to better code, better implementation and, of    course, actual documentation. This talk isn't just about philosophy. It covers actual    experiences and contains practical tips and solutions to get started. Discover how    easy it is to write down your ideas and iteratively develop the documentation. Learn    some of the tools to use to make your documentation look great. Find out that writing    things down doesn't have to be a chore, but can be liberating, and helpful when    working with non-technical people.</p>",

The Google Play store has the largest install    base, and iOS undoubtedly generates the most revenues. But for developers looking    for a new opportunity, can the Windows 8 store offer opportunities the established    players can't? During this talk, we will demonstrate how it's still early days in    the Windows 8 store, and now is the time to get your app in the store and capitalize    on this new and growing market. We will cover what we have seen by having a top    10 app, a top 100 app, and a low-tier app in the store at the same time. During    the second portion of our talk, we will do a 'deep dive' and look at analytics of    user behavior inside mobile applications, what metrics drive revenues, and how you    can capture metrics in your app (whether on Windows, Android or iOS) to increase    your revenues too.</p>",

If the answer is    yes, perhaps you should be taking a look at Groovy. It sort of looks like Java,    acts like Java, and under the covers really is Java (i.e. it compiles to byte code)    so one could say it acts like a duck, talks like a duck, and therefore must be a    duck. So, what exactly is that duck? It is a language that - supports closures for    functional programming - can be either dynamically or statically typed (depending    on the preferences of the programmer or the context of the code) - has built in    mocking, which achieves great power through closures, while at the same time - looks    like and plays well with Java - interoperates with Spring - is understood by IntelliJ    Interested, come and chat about real life experiences of Groovy into Java code bases.</p>",

Can a user speak with a sales person in    their browser if they have a question about a product on your web site? These are    just a few opportunities, beyond the LCD or touch screen, that you might be missing    to interface with your users. There are approximately 7 billion users on the global    telecom network. That's over twice as many as computers and smart phones combined.    Creating rich voice and SMS interfaces will allow you to reach more people and serve    your existing customers better than ever before. Twilio makes creating these \"no-screen\"    user interfaces incredibly easy. If you've created a web page before, you've already    got what it takes to create a phone or SMS interface with Twilio. In this session,    we will explore how and where to add telephony into an existing application using    the Twilio platform. After a high-level overview of Twilio, we will live code new    voice and SMS features into an existing web application. We'll demonstrate how developers    can receive and respond to text messages and voice calls, and how developers can    reach out to any of the ~7 billion users on the global telecom network at any time.    Finally, we will demonstrate how developers can turn any web browser, iDevice, or    Android device with a network connection into a VoIP telephone using Twilio Client.    Code examples will be primarily JavaScript and Ruby, but the core concepts will    be applicable to any server-side programming environment. No previous experience    with telecom or a particular web development framework will be assumed. Voice and    SMS are the next frontier of usability, and Twilio can help you blaze the trail.</p>",

Tickers, dashboards and real-time systems will become more ubiquitous and    stuffed full of data than we see today. The philosophy of the world wide web being    a medium for static data is almost non-existent, yet the infrastructure hasn’t changed    in years. In this talk, we will explore how Microsoft proposes to solve this issue    with SignalR, Azure Service Bus and ASP.NET MVC 3 to build a horizontally scalable    solution to a real-time internet problem.</p>",

Before you know it, you’ve    amassed a large amount of technical debt in an application where very few folks    use all the features or worse, no one buys. What if there was a tool you could use    to help keep you focused, validate your idea before writing a line of code and help    save you time and money? In this session, we’ll cover the basics of the Lean Startup    process and learning how to apply it to product development through using the Validation    Board.</p>",

Specifically, we will dive in to audiolib.js - an open source JavaScript library    that wraps browser-specific API's. We'll discover basics such as oscillators, LFO's,    samplers, and using effects like reverb and delay. We'll also dig in to more complex    topics such as envelopes, custom synth instruments, custom effects, and building    a sequencer in your browser.</p>",

Before you click that button, it might be a good idea to make sure you understand    the Windows Store certification process to make sure you don't encounter any publication    delays due to certification failures that could have been easily avoided. In this    session, you'll learn more about the end-to-end process to publish an app to the    Store, including monetization options, submission flow and best practices, and certification    tips and tricks.
