    "abstract": "<p>\tCome explore Elm,  a functional programming language for making web things. Elm aims to solve some of the same problems that Ember, React, and Angular 2 solve, but in a radically different way. Strong and static typing ensures that data you pass around in your apps really is what you think it is. A simple and tried-and-true architecture makes it easy to understand, and great tooling makes it fun to use.</p><p>\tIn this talk, we'll explore how we use Elm to build our user interface and our code, and we'll take an honest look at where Elm can make a difference for you, and where it falls short. By the end of the talk, you'll know how to get started and have all the resources you need to explore Elm on your own.</p>",

Semantic UI is a framework that aims to create rich UIs “using human-friendly HTML.”  Gone are the days of col-md-3.  Instead, our HTML will have classes like “three column wide”. But it’s more than that. Semantic UI has a wide variety of elements, collections, and views that can make any application pop, all while following sane patterns.</p><p>\tThroughout this talk, we’ll look at several key UI components, and talk about the underlying principles of Semantic UI.

You will learn how TypeScript can help augment your development experience and your existing knowledge as a Javascript developer by adding type safety, OO concepts, and ES6 features to your codebase. If you consider yourself a C# or .NET developer and do Javascript on the side, TypeScript is a great fit for all the paradigms you're used to. If you work in a Linux or Mac world, you’ll still be able to leverage TypeScript with cross-platform tooling. Come and learn something that might help you become more productive and make your applications more robust and less scary to refactor.

Learn how to build real-time server-to-client and client-to-server push services in ASP.NET using SignalR. SignalR makes it incredibly simple to build communication hubs for real-time notifications, peer-to-peer collaboration, and real-time content delivery. SignalR is flexible, extensible and scalable. We will cover setting up a complete MVC5 application using both the Javascript client API and the .NET client. There are several transport protocols available depending on which server and client platforms you are using. We will discuss these options as well as extending, scaling and customizing SignalR.</p>",

These packages include: F# Data, which utilizes F#’s type provider system to create concrete types without boilerplate classes; Deedle, which allows swift in-memory manipulations and transformations of data; and visualization and more packages. We’ll touch on F# syntax as we go. Come join and take a crash course through these tools</p>",

Even if you avoid \"third party\" open source components, Microsoft is open sourcing more and more of .NET itself that it is inescapable. So should you be worried? Didn't Steve Ballmer tell us open source was bad and dangerous? Well, there are things you should know about open source in terms of licensing, maintainability, support. Many are things you need to think about when using ANY code you didn't write yourself, whether open source or not. By the end of this session you'll understand where open source does and doesn't differ from traditional proprietary tools, libraries, and frameworks. You might still be worried, but you'll understand WHY you are worried.</p>",
