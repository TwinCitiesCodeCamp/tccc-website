Windows Forms is out and \"Modern UI\" (Formerly    \"Metro\") is in. During this session we'll start by designing our database schema    in SQL Server. Next, we'll expose our data via an HTTP API using Web API. Then we'll    tie it all together by writing a Windows 8 Modern UI-style application that consumes    our data and makes it available to the user. If we want to finish we'll need to    do away with the pleasantries and write code right out of the gate.</p>",

Getting started with Knockout is easy, but as your application grows in complexity,    it can be challenging to keep your code clean and performing optimally. In this    session, we will talk about the tools, tricks, and techniques that you can use to    take your Knockout application to the next level. Topics will include extending    Knockout's structures, creating custom bindings, taking advantage of some lesser-known    Knockout APIs and avoiding common performance issues.</p>",

A simple mistake can cause    the entire user interface to fail in spectacular ways. This book will give you the    grounding you need to develop test-first client-side code so you can avoid messes    and have more confidence in your applications. In this talk, you'll learn to use    CoffeeScript and the Jasmine testing library to develop solid, testable client-side    code. We'll cover how to create encapsulated code, how to stub out remote calls,    and how to automate the test suite so it can run automatically in the background    or as part of a continuous integration server. If you write client side code but    need to know how to test it, this talk is for you.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    The Hells Angels motorcycle club is one of the most famously known motorcycle clubs.    When you read about their infamous violence or run-ins with the law you rarely think    about them and how they use a computer or surf the internet. When professionals    talk about usability, it’s hard not to think of people similar to themselves - but    what if your customers are not \"typical\" web users? How do you build for them or    discover how they interact with your site? In this talk Keith and Tim share their    real-world experience managing <a href=\"http://www.jpcycles.com\" target=\"_blank\">jpcycles.com</a>    (one of the world's 500 largest retail websites) and how they are working to identify    their customers' needs and adjusting their site to make it more friendly to their    motorcycle riding customers. Tim and Keith will share openly and honestly about    the tools they are using daily to maximize the experience and uncover \"truth\" in    their customers. Interestingly great website design is much aligned with the Hells    Angels motto: \"When we do right, nobody remembers. When we do wrong, nobody forgets.\"</p>",
