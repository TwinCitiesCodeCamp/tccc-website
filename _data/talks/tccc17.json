    "abstract": "<p>    Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as Specification by Example, Behavior Driven Development (BDD), Example-Driven Development (EDD), and Story Test-Driven Development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer’s needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. This talk will focus on why we need to do ATDD, How we can include ATDD into our development process, the advantages and challenges in implementing ATDD. Examples for this talk will be in .Net/SpecFlow. If you are a Developer, Tester, Business Analyst, Product Owner or a stakeholder in a software development project this talk will show you how you could build products with in-built quality and value and can be extended easily.</p>",

In this attackers advantage and a defenders dilemma, how do you keep your data and secrets safe? Today’s ever changing technology landscape means that the fundamentals of writing secure code are more important than ever. In this session we take a look at the secure development approach and go thru the top exploits that you need to know about. We'll show how you can use .NET features to stop exploits before they happen. You don’t want to be at the center of the next media frenzy over lost data and compromised records, or lose your customers confidence and trust in how you do business.  From injection attacks and cross site scripting to security misconfiguration we look at the hacker's psyche and show how they think and work, and learn what we can do to build more secure software.</p>",

Many people still see the public cloud as prohibitively expensive; particularly if they are used to large on-premise servers with very fast processors and high quantities of memory per server. However; on Azure, it is more economical to \"scale out\" rather than \"scale up\". In this speech, I will discuss techniques for developing a highly scalable app for the Azure cloud, as well as minimizing the cost of hosting while maximizing performance.</p>",

The original paper by Roy Fielding that coined the phrase was actually talking about something quite different than what we think of REST being today. His idea’s focus was the messages (media types) used to transition from one state to another in a process oriented design using a small number of “verbs”. This is quite different from the entity oriented designs where the client holds the knowledge of the overall process that we have grown used to. At the center of the style is a state machine that is used to tell the client what it’s possible next steps are which it does with every response. Come and explore what a hypermedia design looks like from both the client (Wordpress plugin or javascript) and server’s (in c#) perspective with an application written on the Hypertext Application Language (HAL).</p><ul>    <li>What do mean only one starting url?</li>    <li>Hey you changed the url of my kittens link, what the heck!</li>    <li>So I can just ignore that rel and profile stuff, ok?</li>    <li>A resource, so you just mean my database, right?</li>    <li>A media type is like my mp3’s, right?</li>    <li>I love version numbers, so where do they go?</li>    <li>How do know when I can update my kitten photo and when I can’t?</li>    <li>No hacker will try to use this I am pretty sure.</li></ul>",

The Kinect HD for Windows was officially released to the public on July 15th.   However they haven’t released all the features of the SDK to the public yet.  I am proud and excited to show you the great new features that come with the Kinect HD sensor.</p><p>    Besides being a full HD (1920x1080) sensor, it also allows you to track up to six people simultaneously.   Body tracking has greater detail and more points to work with.   The sensor is less susceptible to ambient lighting.   The overall programming interface has been updated to be much more efficient.   Audio filtering has been greatly enhanced to minimize noise.   You can even use the Kinect HD sensor for Windows Store Apps.</p><p>    There are many exciting possibilities for the Kinect HD sensor.

Yet from humble beginnings nearly four years ago, we have an open web standard for .NET that the community and Microsoft have fully embraced. From hosting with Katana or Helios to new frameworks and middleware free from the legacy of System.Web, the future of .NET web development will look much different from its past. This session will give a brief overview of OWIN and the current landscape, discuss its implications for .NET web application design, and review a real-world example of OWIN in action.</p>",

Some of the implementations add support for compile to JavaScript languages, module loaders and real time backends. This presentation will demonstrate a TodoMVC implementation which adds support for the forthcoming W3C Web Cryptography API, as well as review some key cryptographic concepts and definitions.</p><p>    Instead of storing the Todo list as plaintext in localStorage, this \"secure\" TodoMVC implementation encrypts Todos using a password derived key. The PBKDF2 algorithm is used for the deriveKey operation, with getRandomValues generating a cryptographically random salt. The importKey method sets up usage of AES-CBC for both encrypt and decrypt operations. The final solution helps address item \"A6-Sensitive Data Exposure\" from the OWASP Top 10.</p><p>    With the Web Cryptography API being a recommendation in 2014, any Q&amp;A time will likely include browser implementations and limitations, and whether JavaScript cryptography adds any value.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    If you are a full stack developer, you probably occasionally work with stylesheets. If you feel like you are poking a stick blindly into a house of cards when you do, this session is for you. Web design has come a long way since styles were inline and dispersed throughout the markup. Browser support of CSS3 is better, preprocessors have become ubiquitous, and tables are blasphemous. If you haven't been immersed, it's easy to feel lost. This session aims to give you a solid understanding of modern CSS development.</p><p>    We will review how preprocessors make life easier. We'll differentiate between SASS, Stylus, and LESS and take a look at the Compass framework and libraries like Bourbon. We'll quickly touch responsive design, some of the best parts of CSS3, and testing. The retrospective portion of the talk will involve looking at patterns I've used and encountered. We'll call out the good, bad and ugly to find anti-patterns and appropriate use of what is working. SAAS and lean proof-of-concepts require different strategies, but both should have styles that are scalable and maintainable. We'll define the tools and patterns that can make this possible. You won't be a ninja, but you will be able to include considerations of this important piece of your app's UI when architecting it and help guide practices that will result in better deployments and coverage.</p>",
