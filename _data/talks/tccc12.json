We will demonstrate how to quickly capture    data from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as the Wii Balance Board, Zephyr Bioharness,    and others using both WPF and Android applications. Once the data is captured, we    will store these real-time results in MongoDB and provide a simple web service secured    with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) to access and submit data securely from mobile    devices. Providing efficient, integrated services such as these will be increasingly    important in providing the best data and analysis possible to both healthcare providers    and consumers.</p>",

JavaScript has    moved far beyond tricks like manipulating an HTML DOM and is being used to build    powerful client-side (and server-side) libraries. As these libraries become more    complex, inheritance can play a major role in how these libraries are implemented,    consumed, and customized. With JavaScript's dynamic nature there is more than one    approach you can take to achieve inheritance. Some of these approaches have performance    implications, while others are more a matter of taste and style. In this session    we'll discuss these approaches and which ones are best for different scenarios.</p>",

Many of us find ourselves struggling to keep up with    the complexity of the evolving systems we support. Have you applied best practices    but still feel like you could have better - a lot better? I have. Come find out    what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise    system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords    can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to    share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture.    I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design    of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to    continue your journey.</p>",

Programming teaches    kids many valuable lessons: how to think logically and rationally, how to plan ahead,    how to problem solve, and how to swear properly. But how do we teach kids to program    today? When we were kids we were ecstatic to see a green blinking cursor on the    screen prompting us to type our name so we could have the program print it repeatedly    on the page while(true). How do we get today’s kids with XBoxes and Nintendos interested    in rudimentary programming of “if” statements? In this session Tommy Davis (age    9) and his dad Scott will discuss four programming languages and how they work for    kids: Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, Python, and C#. We will demonstrate each language    and talk about Tom’s experience in each, what worked well and what didn’t, and what    approaches you might take to get your own kids into programming. Tommy attended    his first Twin Cities Code Camp last fall, where he showed off the Windows Phone    game he had made before coming to the conference as the youngest programmer in attendance.</p>",

As it turns out, taking the path of humility towards your market    is a far more productive path. You can start with a small hypothesis - test that    hypothesis against real customers. Using continuous delivery, you can rapidly iterating    over your product, using data, rather than opinion, to guide your product development    efforts. Such an approach not only costs less money, it allows you to vet the initiative    before it becomes \"too big to fail\".
