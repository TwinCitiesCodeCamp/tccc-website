    "abstract": "<p>    The .NET framework is perhaps the most extensible, and stable way to go about cross-platform    development. Unlike native languages, it offers a byte-code which can be JITted    to high-performance native code at runtime, and offers near-native speeds on various    platforms such as Windows Phone, Windows 98-Windows 7, Windows 8, and Linux. Although    the same byte-code can be run on all platforms, the difficulty is often finding    libraries that will work on all these platforms, without the need to re-write your    code for each one. In this session, I will be introducing a cross-platform library,    which works seamlessly across all these platforms, and can be used to write high-performance    games, and other 3D applications for all the platforms above. This project is currently    available as an open-source library on <a href=\"https://github.com/IDWMaster/3DAPI\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>, and anyone is welcome to contribute to it.</p>",

Perhaps you wondered    why you'd want to use Windows Workflow instead of just writing code. In this session    we will go over the basics of using Windows Workflow. In addition, we will cover    some common use cases where Windows Workflow can simplify development and save you    time while increasingthe flexibility of your software.</p>",

As distributed    systems like Git and Mercurial have taught us, it turns out it matters quite a bit.    This talk will review the core concepts of distributed version control, show off    a few advanced features you didn't know you needed, and discuss options for getting    started now rather than later.</p>",

This session will help you wade through the staggering number of development options    available and give you the info needed to make the right decisions for your Client,    Product or Organization. We'll start with an overview of the Mobile ecosystem and    the basic concepts of the Cocoa Touch framework. From there we'll dig into MonoTouch    and show the power and flexibility it provides over native Objective-C development.    We'll also give a tour of some time saving libraries like MonoTouch.Dialog that,    well, just make our lives easier.</p>",
