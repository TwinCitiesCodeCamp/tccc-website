In this talk we bring this robot kicking and screaming into the 21st century. First, we replace it's dusty, cold-war era circuits, with internet-connected microprocessors, then we give it a brain running on a node server that performs speech recognition, speech synthesis, and conversational intelligence with ChatGPT. While you may not have your own Reagan-era robot to recreate this this temporal violation, you'll learn how to add intelligence to node apps for any century.",
