    "abstract": "<p>    Software testing has gained a lot of interest in the recent past. Similarly, determining    system capabilities has been something people increasingly care about. But how do    you truly know what your system's capabilities are? How do you know for instance,    that the result of a stress test are not just a fluke or isolated incident? How    can you make accurate and responsible predictions about scalability? A few mathematical    techniques collectively known as Statistical Process control can provide an excellent    mechanism for measuring system performance and resource usage. It provides a solid    theoretical framework so there's no more \"Seems to me like it should do ______\"    or \"Well, to me it looks right...\" Statistical Process control was the driving force    behind Toyota, Nissan and Honda's successes, as well as Sony, Nakamichi and many    other brands known for their quality. And it can be applied to virtually every aspect    of software. To use it, you need a pencil, piece of paper and a calculator, although    a copy of Excel makes it really simple. No expensive tools needed and no heavy learnign    curve.</p>",

Writing your own code generation templates is coding,    pure and simple (well perhaps not so simple). I am going to show you how to code    templates using XML/XSLT, CodeSmith, MyGeneration, and (maybe) Orcas Software Factories.    This will include a lot of code from templates that I have written (will write)    for generating CSLA applications. One of the problems in generating code is how    to extend the generated functionality. No matter how cleverly you code the code    generation templates, there will always be some functionality that makes more sense    to generate by hand. I will take a look at three different approaches to how to    add that functionality to the generated code: using partial classes, using inheritance,    and using delegates. Unit testing is one very important factor in wanting to extend    to extend the generated code. I will cover some ways to structure the code, generated    and hand-crafted, to support unit testing.</p>",
