HLSL allows graphics programmers to create realistic graphics through the    use of a combination of math algorithms and the hardware they are processed on.    Around the time of DirectX 8, shaders were implemented to allow changes per geometric    shape, vertex, and pixel during a frame render. As one of the items comes to render    on the graphics device, the math algorithm written into the shader file is applied    to the respective object and is rendered to the screen. Current technology has reached    the point where shaders are a necessity for any graphics developer, considering    graphics libraries such as Microsoft's XNA have removed support for a non-programmed,    ‘fixed' graphics pipeline. A simple shader is built to emulate a point light while    each step includes reasoning behind the code and relevance to the theory of a point    light. A conclusion is given explaining other uses for shaders.</p>",

The majority of the time the business requires that these rules systems    must be consumable by other applications. Come see how we can utilize the Rules    Engine within Windows Workflow Foundation to evaluate our rules and simplify our    rules configuration. We will then encompass this functionality within a Windows    Communication Foundation Service which will enable consumers to utilize the service.</p>",

This continuing change cannot    happen if the software design and implementation is riddled with dependencies: A    change to module A triggers changes in B and C, that collectively, trigger more    changes in D, E, F, and G and so on until the software explodes. This sounds like    a terrific special-effects movie but a very bad information technology experience.    There are design practices that build \"fire walls\" that isolate one part of the    software from other parts, but ultimately the question becomes, how can one part    of the software invoke the services of another part without becoming dependent on    that other part? This sounds very much like a Zen riddle: \"What is the sound of    one hand clapping?\"</p><p>    Enter the twin concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. With Inversion    of Control, when a particular module of the software is dependent upon a particular    service, say logging, that dependency is abstracted down to an interface. Any invocation    of the logging function is made against the interface. Before the module can execute,    it must obtain a reference to an object that implements the interface. There are    a lot of ways to accomplish this: 1) passing the reference as a part of instantiating    or invoking the functions of the module, 2) returning the reference from a factory    method, and 3) injecting the dependency reference as part of a Dependency Injection    framework.</p><p>    We will look the design patterns for Inversion of Control and demonstrate code that    uses the following Dependency Injection frameworks:</p><ul>    <li>Castle Windsor</li>    <li>StructureMap</li>    <li>Unity</li>    <li>Spring.NET</li></ul>",

He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.

He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at.
