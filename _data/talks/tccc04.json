    "title": "ORM – Not Just for Meditation Any More",
    "abstract": "<p>    The \"shape\" of data in a relational database is not the same as the \"shape\" of data    in an object oriented application. That is as it should be; for both efficiency    and effectiveness, the goals for storing data are different from those of manipulating    it within the application. The question is how to bridge the inevitable gap between    the two environments. For an increasing number of projects, an Object Relational    Mapping (ORM) package is the answer. An ORM allows the developer (1) to declaratively    define a conceptual model of how the application wants to see the data, (2) to point    to an existing data store (e.g., a database), and (3) to define a mapping between    the conceptual and physical data. From this declarative model, the ORM generates    the code to move data back and forth between the application's view of the data    and the data store's view of the data. We will write several versions of a simple    (yet compelling) application using the new Entity Framework ORM package from Microsoft,    using NHiberate from the open source world, and using LLBGenPro from the non-Microsoft    commercial world. Comparing and contracting will take place. Look for a few \"Top    Ten\" lists about ORM: features to look for, reasons to use ORM, functionality other    than data mapping that ORM provides, and ORM practices to avoid.</p><p>Presentation Material</p><ul>    <li><a href=\"http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/2008-Spring-Code-Camp.aspx\">Code Drop</a></li>    <li><a href=\"http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/The-PowerPoint-Deck-for-the-ORM-Talk.aspx\">Slide Deck</a></li></ul>",

He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.

He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at.

But, for many, their understanding of SQL never grew much beyond    the basic CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations, some joins and occasionally    the basics of using a cursor. Are you tired of taking all your SQL problems to other    developers, begging for help? Want to become ‘The SQL Guy' that everybody else brings    their questions to? Join me for a rapid fire session that will help transform you    from SQL White-belt to SQL Black belt.
