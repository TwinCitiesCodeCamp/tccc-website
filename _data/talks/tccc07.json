    "abstract": "<p>    Building an app using XAML is different from both earlier Windows and web development    models. While there's still room for the MVC and MVP design patterns, the unique    capabilities of XAML mean that the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern is    often a better option. In this session you'll get a basic understanding of the MVVM    design pattern itself, and more importantly will see practical examples of its use    in building Silverlight and WPF applications.</p>",

The Spark    view engine is an alternative view engine for the ASP.NET MVC and MonoRail frameworks.    The idea of Spark is to allow html to dominate the flow and to allow the code to    fit seamlessly into it. We will delve into creating an ASP.NET MVC app with Spark,    Visual Studio Intellisense integration, and finally wrap things up by unit testing    a Spark view for acceptance testing.

Ruby has caught the attention    of Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, and Sun, powers sites like Yellowpages.com and Hulu,    and is an absolute joy to work with. In this presentation, you'll learn the fundamentals    of Ruby, and you'll see it in action as we build a simple web service using the    Sinatra microframework, a static web site with StaticMatic, and we'll test a web    site using Cucumber and our browser. Ruby is a lot more than Rails, so come learn    about it today!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    Microsoft has embraced the popular jQuery open source JavaScript library, which    is already used by many major web sites. jQuery provides a very productive enivornment    for client side programming in JavaScript. It takes advantage of existing knowledge    of CSS selector syntax to offer a powerful and efficient alternative to the DOM.    The use of operation chaining and implicit iteration lead to a very compact and    productive syntax. The library is very lean at a mere 15K, yet provides a strong    base and a great extensibility model which has led to a large number of plugin extensions    to simplify web development. The session will review how to use the library for    very useful features such as watermarks, avoiding browser inconsistencies, and making    AJAX calls to the server. Several plug ins will be demonstrated which provide stunning    client experiences with as little as 1 line of code! We will also study how to extend    the library with our own custom utility funcitons and plug ins. Learn how Jquery    and the Microsoft AJAX Library JavaScript libraries greatly simplify client side    development, and which to use for particular scenarios.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    With the open-source release of Adobe's Flex SDK, anyone can start developing Flash    applications. It's true that Adobe's tools -- the Flash and Flex IDEs -- help make    developing Flash applications easier. But with knowledge of some particular parts    of the Flex compiler and Actionscript 3, a person could actually run a professional    Flash development business with no up front cost! Join Andrew as he takes you through    downloading and configuring the Flex SDK with a particularly cool and free IDE.    You'll see Actionscript 3 in action, covering those aspects of the language that    will help you make real-world interactive applications. Together you'll make an    XML-driven website navigation menu. Come and get your Flash development career started    for free!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>    Did you know Visual Studio 2008 comes with a code generator? Well it does, and you    should learn to use it so you can stop writing repetitive code (i.e. DTO's and DAL's)    and generate it. Come to this session to learn about the Text Template Transformation    Toolkit (T4). T4 allows you to use simple ASP.NET-like template syntax to generate    application source code, configuration files, stored procedures and more. This session    will give you all the information you need to start using T4 effectively in your    project, TODAY! We will go from basics (such as T4 template syntax) to advanced    topics (such as template design and use of T4 in large projects) stopping along    the way to create several templates from scratch.</p><p>    This will be a PowerPoint free presentation. No slides, just code!</p>",
