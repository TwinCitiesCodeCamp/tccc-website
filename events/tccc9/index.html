          <p>    Axum is a programming language launched as an incubation project within Microsoft    DevLabs. Unlike traditional object-oriented languages, Axum is an actor-oriented    language that uses principles of isolation, actors, and message-passing to increase    application safety, responsiveness, scalability, and developer productivity. This    presentation will include a walkthrough of small sample applications written in    Axum for Visual Studio 2010 that offers an overview of the Axum language.</p>

          <p>    Our ability to accurately estimate the software development process might be more    important than our ability to actually write code. Estimation can be both art and    science, but a lot of developers don't even know where to begin. Poor estimates    can lead to missed deadlines, lost opportunities, and a lack of trust between management    and developers. This conversational presentation (light on code) will help you avoid    the common pitfalls of project estimation. You'll leave armed with smarter estimation    techniques and more accurate ways to communicate what's going to happen and when.</p>

          <p>    In certain .NET circles there has been a lot of talk as of late about the Managed    Extensibility Framework, or MEF. You may have even heard some of this chatter, but    you're probably asking yourself "What the heck is MEF and why should I care?" At    its core, MEF is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. MEF    is an integral part of the .NET Framework, and Silverlight 4 shipped with out-of-the    box support for MEF. In this session we'll dive into the guts of MEF looking at    what it is, why you might want to consider using it, and how to actual implement    MEF in your Silverlight applications.</p>

          <p>    Most of us developers have that bug, you know the one, the itch, the drive to create,    to start something. But, the inertia of the couch is sometimes just too much to    overcome. We've got the skill and the ideas, but sometimes we just need a kick.    One terrific kick is Startup Weekend (Nov 19-21, go sign up ,we'll wait). In this    session Andy Pickett describes how Startup Weekend provided that launch pad and    just enough boost for his teammates to get something real off the ground. That something    is QONQR, the GeoSocial Game of World Domination! This session will be 1 part code,    1 part business, 1 part game theory, and 100% awesome. We'll walk through the process    of the startup from pitch to design to alpha to beta and beyond. It will include    a tour through the (3 week old) codebase that is QONQR (including a Mobile Web front    end using ASP.Net MVC 2 and jQuery, a Tactical Command Center written in Silverlight,    and SQL Server back end). Hopefully this will just be a fun, maybe inspiring conversation    about getting something started. There will be absolutely no best practices or patterns    displayed, as well as no legally binding business advice of any kind, this much    we promise you.</p>

          <p>    All the hype would suggest that HTML5 will someday replace plugin based technologies    for the web like Flash and SilverLight but what can you safely use today? How will    HTML5 affect the popular page layout patterns we have all come to expect on the    web? How can we use features in the HTML5 spec to build better page layouts? We    will also touch on closely related specifications for HTML5 such as W3C's ARIA (Accessible    Rich Internet Application) and learn how to build richer more accessible forms by    extending the semantics of HTML5 even further.</p>

This session will discuss why you need it, how to use it, and what makes it different    from any other shell on any platform. Beyond its traditional uses for system administration,    PowerShell provides full access to .NET for Read-Eval-Print loops (REPL), rapid    prototyping, object exploration and extensibility. After an overview of language    features and what's new in version 2.0, we dive into an interactive demo, so come    prepared with questions you have or problems we can solve together.</p>

          <p>    If Cloud computing is "the next big thing" in web development what do we, the developer,    need to do to prepare to write applications that will run on the Windows Azure platform?    In this session we will take a look at what Windows Azure is and how developing    applications for deployment in the cloud differs from writing applications that    are hosted onsite. We will look at the Development Fabric which simulates the Windows    Azure fabric on your local computer so that you can run and test your service locally    before deploying it to the cloud. We will also take a look at the Windows Azure    storage options including queues, tables, blobs, and SQL Azure. Finally we'll use    the dev fabric to write a simple application that may be deployed to the cloud.</p>

          <p>    To successfully create a ubiquitous data access technology that can work with any    data source, Microsoft needed to build a framework that anyone can work with to    introduce their own providers. This ubiquitous data access technology is called    Language Integrated Query (LINQ). Today, Microsoft ships several LINQ providers    out-of-the-box: LINQ to Objects, LINQ to DataSet, LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Entities,    LINQ to XML, and LINQ to Data Services. There are also many 3rd party LINQ providers    for various data sources, made possible by reusable .NET Framework types. LINQ to    Twitter is one such 3rd party provider, which is the example used in this presentation.    You'll learn how LINQ to Twitter is implemented with various interfaces and patterns    to expose the common LINQ development experience you've grown accustomed to with    other providers. The main difference is that the data source is Twitter. Since LINQ    to Twitter is open source, you also have a working example and will gain insight    into how to create your own LINQ provider, should you ever have a need to do so.    Additionally, by looking inside of the process used to build a LINQ provider, you'll    gain a deeper understanding of how LINQ works across all providers.</p>

This session    will go over some real world applications and show how Entity Framework made our    job - and lives - easier. This will include patterns considered for Orbject Relational    Mapping (ORM), pitfalls to avoid, lessons learned and why Entity Framework was used    over other ORM options.</p>

          <p>    If your first thought when deciding to build a web application with Ruby is to run    "rails APPNAME", I'm here to tell you: You're doing it all wrong. Ok, that was a    bit harsh. But you needed to hear it. Q: Has Ruby on Rails transformed the way we    think about building web applications? A: Yes. Q: But isn't it true that using Rails    is extremely simple to use even if I haven't done Ruby before? A: Yes. Q: So Rails    is what I should you use build Ruby web applications? A: Maybe. If Rails is a hammer,    it's my goal to show you that your next project may not need nails. I hope to show    you the benefits of how using simple Ruby can put you on the path to better application    design. I'll also show you a few tools of the Rubyist's trade that enable you to    build a modular web application from emerging needs of your problem space. In the    end we'll come full circle and I'll show you how the Rails philosophy is shifting    in the direction of modular design and how we can leverage all of our knowledge    with Rails to build powerful Ruby applications for the web.</p>

In the session, we will cover the following topics:</p><ul>    <li>Using F# based Monte-Carlo simulation to avoid another global financial crisis</li>    <li>        • Using F# based Natural Language Processing to solve the problem of "incivility        on the Internet"    </li></ul><p>    As we go through these examples, you will see how F# is particularly useful for    solving these types of problems that involve simulation and categorization.</p>

Windows Communication Foundation, WCF,    is Microsoft's comprehensive framework toward that end. In this session we'll analyze    and discuss the fundamental mechanics behind developing (including migrating existing    libraries to) WCF service libraries, hosting the libraries, and consuming them.    We'll analyze all three of these aspects in some detail from existing underlying    object models to extending parts of the framework to support varying consumer needs.    We'll identify and highlight the inner workings of Windows Communication Foundation    to get the most of what the framework has to offer.</p>
