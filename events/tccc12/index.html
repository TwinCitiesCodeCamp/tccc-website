        <p>    In this session, the speaker and the audience will "pair up" for a coding session    which will serve as an introduction to Test Driven Development in an Agile environment.    We will use C#, Visual Studio and Rhino Mocks to unit test code to be built both    with and without dependencies. We will also highlight some of the common issues    encountered during TDD and discuss strategies for overcoming them.</p>

        <p>    As the trend of cutesy, fluidly animated 2D characters with a cartoon twist continues    in the world of mobile games, developers need to come to grips with the technologies    used by the pros to create and render this sort of game content. This session will    take a deep-dive into the world of creating fantastic, realistic 2D characters/animations    using simple sketches and freely available tools. We'll also see how to efficiently    and flexibly render complex characters using WP7+XNA (Reach profile), touching upon    topics like animation blending, artist-driven inverse kinematics and integration    with physics engines like Farseer.</p>

        <p>    Learn a bit about how to use artificial life algorithms and evolutionary algorithms    to survive the coming zombie apocalypse. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by    some mechanisms from biologicial evolution (reproduction, mutation, recombination    and selection) but aren't hindered by silly little things like how real biological    systems actually work. We can harness these ideas to solve problems and optimize    strategies that can help us get through our day to day activities or help us avoid    having our brains eaten. The presentation will range from fundamental ideas to functional    demos done in JavaScript (or CoffeeScript).</p>

        <p>    Asynchronous programming (async) is emerging as a common programming practice, especially    in .NET technologies such as Silverlight. In sophisticated scenarios, async can    be complex, which is why Microsoft is adding language support in the next version    of .NET. This talk will cover the current state of async, what the challenges are,    and how your job will be made easier with the new language features.</p>

        <p>    In this session we will cover several topics related to obtaining, storing, and    analyzing health and fitness data. With the increasing number of cheap, portable    monitoring devices, individuals can capture and record health-related data almost    constantly. Unfortunately, few of these devices are capable of integrating or providing    a useful assessment of the measurements. We will demonstrate how to quickly capture    data from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as the Wii Balance Board, Zephyr Bioharness,    and others using both WPF and Android applications. Once the data is captured, we    will store these real-time results in MongoDB and provide a simple web service secured    with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) to access and submit data securely from mobile    devices. Providing efficient, integrated services such as these will be increasingly    important in providing the best data and analysis possible to both healthcare providers    and consumers.</p>

        <p>    There has been a resurgence if interest in C++. Boost is a set of open source C++    libraries that are designed to work well with the C++ Standard Library. The libraries    are peer reviewed and many of the libraries are implementations of upcoming C++    standard library releases. The libraries are cross platform and work on most modern    operating systems. The presentation will cover some common libraries that you may    want to use to simplify and speed up your C++ development.</p>

        <p>    Windows 8 offers the exciting new “Windows Runtime (WInRT)” platform for application    development. This new platform is similar to Silverlight in many ways, though it    also supports JavaScript and C++ technologies in addition to .NET. CSLA .NET is    a widely used open source framework for building reusable business logic in .NET    that can run on .NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone, and Android. In this talk you    will learn how CSLA .NET is being enhanced to support the new WinRT platform as    well, allowing you to take your existing CSLA-based business logic and simply recompile    it for use in building WinRT applications.</p>

        <p>    It's widely regarded that JavaScript becomes a bit of a mess when scaled out to    large project sizes. Yet the increase of client-side programming, and the advent    of Node.js has driven us to use this language for lack of other options. Here, we'll    examine Dart, Google's solution to the problem, and see how it stacks up against    alternatives like CoffeeScript.</p>

In this session I will show some techniques    for drinking from the information fire hose, and quickly discuss some late-breaking    technologies that web developers should be investing some time to learn, including    MVC, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, Jasmine, CoffeeScript, Bootstrap, KendoUI and more!</p>

        <p>    "When will it be done?" is the question most dreaded by software developers. You    may think the most important tools for creating software estimates are a crystal    ball and a divining rod, but there is a better way that won't involve magic. Plus,    accurate software development estimates can enhance your professional image in your    organization, and make life better by eliminating the mad dash at the end of the    project. This session will improve your estimating accuracy by teaching you several    techniques that I've learned through my 16+ years as a software consultant. It will    also show you how to handle situations where an accurate estimate isn't possible.    Bring your estimating questions and war stories!</p>

        <p>    Expression trees provide many new options for creating reusable code. Understanding    expression trees will allow you to extend LINQ providers or even write your own    LINQ provider. You can also write your own fluent API, removing the need for configuration    or XML files. It is even possible to turn C# statements into Javascript! We will    begin the journey of mastering expression trees, and adding this important skill    to your repertoire.</p>

        <p>    The real world problems we're asked to solve with software are messy, the business    rules change constantly, and they vary by customer or by context. Moving the things    that change regularly into plugins lets you keep your core product solid while maintaining    the flexibility your applications need. We'll use MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework)    provide that functionality to a simple C# application.</p>

        <p>    We will be moving past the basics of the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element and use the    growing 3D library three.js. After going over the limitations and allowances available    to the library, we will go over setting up a scene, the mesh model, primitive geometries,    basic lighting, interaction, and go over tools to help you in your implementation.    This presentation will cover the library being used for WebGL, though we will also    cover the other available renderers.</p>

        <p>    In this session we'll talk about your options to implement inheritance with the    squirmy, naughty, and very powerful language known as JavaScript. JavaScript has    moved far beyond tricks like manipulating an HTML DOM and is being used to build    powerful client-side (and server-side) libraries. As these libraries become more    complex, inheritance can play a major role in how these libraries are implemented,    consumed, and customized. With JavaScript's dynamic nature there is more than one    approach you can take to achieve inheritance. Some of these approaches have performance    implications, while others are more a matter of taste and style. In this session    we'll discuss these approaches and which ones are best for different scenarios.</p>

        <p>    If part of your job is designing architecture for a system then I'm sure you'll    find this talk interesting. Many of us find ourselves struggling to keep up with    the complexity of the evolving systems we support. Have you applied best practices    but still feel like you could have better - a lot better? I have. Come find out    what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise    system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords    can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to    share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture.    I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design    of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to    continue your journey.</p>

See a popular CI tool in action and learn how the practice of continuous integration    will give you more confidence in your software so you can start thinking about continuous    delivery.</p>

And then you wake up only to realize.... IT WASN'T    A DREAM!?! Science tells us that less than 8.268% of Dev Teams use source control    for their database. That's crazy talk! How do you people sleep at night?! Come see    some fresh techniques using tools by Microsoft and Redgate to tame the savage data    beast. We'll explore getting schemas and data into your favorite source control    repository, complete with change history and merge resolution. The Tour de Force    will be leveraging these tools into a Continuous Integration AND Deployment process,    complete with auotmated Test Data Generation and Integration Tests. Then sleep well    at night knowing all your data babies are snuggled in and safe.</p>

        <p>    SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for ASP.NET. It's designed to help    you build real-time web applications without a lot of hassle. In the past, developers    would have to wire up "real-time" applications as a series of polls to a webserver,    waiting for it to receive data back that was useful. This approach usually cost    more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process, and makes    it more useful for the ASP.NET developer. In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will    guide you through implementing SignalR into your applications, and how you can take    advantage of everything it has to offer.</p>

        <p>    Combining two powerful web technoglies - KnockoutJS (MVVM for the web) and SignalR    (Async signaling for real-time, multi-user web applications), you can create a web    application that lets users communicate in real time with minimal development. We'll    quickly explore simple setup for both, then show how nicely they compliment each    other. We'll finish with an audience driven game of "Family Feud" built on this    technology stack.</p>

        <p>    The jQuery JavaScript library has become a household item in the web development    community. It allows for simple event binding, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous    requests. Many developers know they can extend jQuery using their simple plugin    development process ... but did you also know that jQuery is extensible in other    ways as well? We will focus on extending jQuery's event system via the Special Events    API in order to create our own custom bindable events, such as "multiclick", "textSelect",    and "swipe".</p>

        <p>    With the public release of Project Roslyn, Microsoft has finally let .NET developers    get access to their long-awaited compiler APIs. The potential impact of having a    compiler API available for all developers is immense. In this session, you'll get    a tour of the elements behind this new API, such as syntax trees and engines, and    how you can use them in code analysis and metaprogramming techniques.</p>

        <p>    Make more money with your mobile apps. The biggest hurdle in the mobile market right    now is segmentation. We'll cover techniques to create, distribute and market applications    across multiple platforms. Create apps with a variety of screen sizes in mind. Utilize    cross platform tools to distribute software to multiple devices. Take advantage    of mobile display networks to target people outside of the marketplace. Overcome    segmentation and increase the success of your application by reaching out to a larger    audience.</p>

        <p>    The war's over. Web plugins like Silverlight and Flash have served their purpose    well, but the native web is now sufficiently powerful to render web plugins superfluous    and irrelevant. What's a Silverlight developer to do? Enter KnockoutJS. Instead    of throwing away our existing skills built up through Silverlight, I'll show you    how to transfer your skills to the native web via KnockoutJS, using familiar technologies    like data binding, MVVM, templates, and commanding support.</p>

        <p>    Parallel programming remains a difficult task, but the .NET framework keeps making    things easier for developers. With the various constructs available, like the addition    of the Task Parallel Library in .NET 4, it is important to know what is appropriate    for different situations. Devices continue to gain cores and the cloud offers easily    distributed computing, so developers should understand how to utilize the environments.    Come for a walk-through of how and when to use these constructs, whether that is    in the cloud, a mobile device, desktop application or the web.</p>

        <p>    If you are going to code camp, you likely know how valuable programming skills are,    and perhaps you one day want your kids to learn these skills too. Programming teaches    kids many valuable lessons: how to think logically and rationally, how to plan ahead,    how to problem solve, and how to swear properly. But how do we teach kids to program    today? When we were kids we were ecstatic to see a green blinking cursor on the    screen prompting us to type our name so we could have the program print it repeatedly    on the page while(true). How do we get today’s kids with XBoxes and Nintendos interested    in rudimentary programming of “if” statements? In this session Tommy Davis (age    9) and his dad Scott will discuss four programming languages and how they work for    kids: Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, Python, and C#. We will demonstrate each language    and talk about Tom’s experience in each, what worked well and what didn’t, and what    approaches you might take to get your own kids into programming. Tommy attended    his first Twin Cities Code Camp last fall, where he showed off the Windows Phone    game he had made before coming to the conference as the youngest programmer in attendance.</p>

        <p>    The minimum? Why would I only want to do the minimum? It seems counter-intuitive    - the idea that the best path forward when embarking on new product development    should focus on the smallest possible product. Why not go big and try to launch    with a big splash? Won't your customers be turned off by a lack of features and    glorious complexity? As it turns out, taking the path of humility towards your market    is a far more productive path. You can start with a small hypothesis - test that    hypothesis against real customers. Using continuous delivery, you can rapidly iterating    over your product, using data, rather than opinion, to guide your product development    efforts. Such an approach not only costs less money, it allows you to vet the initiative    before it becomes "too big to fail". In this session, we will cover what the MVP    is, how you define one, and how you use validated learning to guide your efforts.    Further, we will cover how agile software development and continuous delivery are    essential to product development efforts that use this approach.</p>

        <p>    WebAPI is a new feature in ASP.NET MVC 4 for building HTTP services. Come this session    to find out why HTTP and WebAPI matter and learn how you can use WebAPI to build    services. You will learn how WebApi enables you to take full advantage of HTTP including    caching, content negotiation, and eTags. In addition you will see how WebAPI integrates    with MVC and how you can use it in a self-host scenario. We’ll cover all the good    stuff like dependency resolution and unit testing of your services too!</p>

        <p>    Right now, there's a focus on creating native applications for mobile devices, but    that can be costly, require a lot of additional time, and may be overkill for what    you're doing. By combining the flexibility of Ruby on Rails with the ease of use    of jQuery Mobile, you can develop quality mobile web apps. In this talk, we'll walk    through creating a simple app, from scratch, that presents both a desktop and mobile    view, and we'll talk about the ups and downs of this approach. Best of all, no prior    knowledge of Ruby on Rails is assumed, and you'll have all the source code you need    to recreate this project on your own.</p>

        <p>    Get the answers to the following questions: What is WinRT? Are you kidding me that    you can use C# libraries in Javascript? Really, what am I "required" to do to get    my app into the marketplace? Tell me Jeff...what do you "really" think about WinRT    and Windows 8? Can you really teach me all I need to know in one session?</p>

        <p>    The what, and how of Windows Server AppFabric caching 1.1. In this talk we will    work with AppFabric Caching, getting it set up, how to place items in the cache,    retrieve them, etc. We will talk about using Powershell to create cache, and monitor    it. We will also talk about the pros and cons of configuration of the AppFabric    Cache service. If we have time we might go over differences b/w Azure Cache and    Windows Server Cache.</p>
