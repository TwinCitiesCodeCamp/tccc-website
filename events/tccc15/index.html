        <p>    There are tons of great MVC web frameworks out in the wild, for most major compiled    and dynamic languages. They're great tools to get projects prototyped and quickly    into production. The Ambition MVC framework is a hobby that turned into a reasonable    web framework. Written using Vala, the Ambition framework allows a developer or    team of developers to create web applications or RESTful services using a static-typed    object oriented language without relying on a VM or a garbage collection cycle.    Plus, being compiled, it allows cloud deployment to be easy and inexpensive, as    memory and CPU requirements can be a fraction of PHP, Ruby, Python, or Perl sites.    While it's not "officially" released, it's available on GitHub, and being actively    developed. Patches, help, and end users are very welcome, and I'd like to show you    more.</p>

        <p>    D3.js is a powerful framework for data visualization. However, when all you need    is a nice looking javascript bar chart, the idea of learning enough D3 get the job    done can be a bit overwhelming. When you stumble upon your first charting library    built on D3.js, you might feel relieved, but when you stumble upon your fifth, you    are probably back to being overwhelmed. This talk will go through some of these    alternatives and help you understand what the differences are between them so you    can decide what makes the most sense for your needs.</p>

        <p>    Spend more time coding and less time dealing with environments, builds, configuration,    creating documentation, testing and talking to people you don't like by creating    tools that support the development process and help you leave at 5PM. We spend all    day creating tools that help the business be more efficient so why don't we create    tools that allow us to be more efficient? Come and learn a bit about how to automate    the configuration of environments (DEV to PROD), wrangle your builds/deployments    and automate ALL THE THINGS from a .Net/Windows perspective. Tools = { .Net, PowerShell,    Psake, Nuget, Chocolatey, Boxstarter, TFS 2013 Build-Deploy-Test, TFS Deployer,    Virtual Machines }</p>

        <p>    Ruby on Rails, and other Model/View/Controller based frameworks, are great tools    for quickly creating web applications. Unfortunately the MVC is not a one-size-fits-all    pattern and it tends to point developers away from proper object-oriented design.    We'll talk about how to organize code beyond the MVC, decoupling application logic    from the MVC, and when it's best to use a Service Layer instead of Models. While    the talk will mostly focus on Rails, we'll be discussing established object-oriented    programming principles and these ideas should be applicable to anyone working with    an MVC-based framework.</p>

        <p>    The web today is far more than your server stack! Content is combined with a rich    interactive layer of JavaScript and mashed up with external social, advertising,    or service providers. All this into a rapidly changing environment of new browsers,    new rendering engines, new libraries, and new plugins. JavaScript can and should    be better--we should know about our errors--and we should fix them! It's our mission    to give you the tools to do this. Let's talk about why you should care about your    clientside errors, and how to build a basic implementation.</p>

        <p>    Mobile development is big and it’s only going to get bigger. You want your app to    work on all major mobile platforms, but not everyone has the time, resources or    even the desire to learn all of the native mobile frameworks. In this presentation,    we’ll learn about how you can make mobile apps that work across all major mobile    platforms without learning several entirely new tech stacks by utilizing cross-platform    mobile development. We’ll go over some of the most popular cross-platform mobile    development frameworks, discuss when to use them vs. native development and when    to use each framework.</p>

        <p>    Learn real world techniques for improving your productivity as a developer. We'll    skip past the hype that it's impossible to measure an individual developer or a    team's productivity and jump right into the meat of learning how to tweak your personal    and team development processes to deliver more value to your clients. This session    will take a look at practices to help you improve, processes, and tools - everything    from automating your app deployment to using a clipboard manager. As one of the    best ways of finding new productivity tweaks is working with other developers, we'll    also gather suggestions from the audience on what works in the wild.</p>

        <p>    HTML5 has brought us many new ways to deliver rich content to the web. The File    System API is one way we can enable offline applications that deal with actual files    in a sand boxed environment for a site. It allows us to store binary files such    as documents, images, and even JSON. The files can then be referenced with file    system URIs to deliver them to the user, build the site itself, or even serve data    using XHR. Learn the basics of the API, dealing with browser compatibility or lack    there of, common use cases, and see tools to help you build your app in this code-centric    presentation. Here is the tests and app I will be reviewing to cover the API: <a href="https://github.com/StephenErstad/FileSystemApiDemo" target="_blank">StephenErstad/FileSystemApiDemo</a>.    It can be run as a Node or .NET web app.</p>

        <p>    There is certainly a lot of uncertainty and doubt around the topic of SPAs (Single    Page Applications), and that makes any experienced programmer afraid. There are    dozens of ways to create SPAs and each one promises to be the best (at least until    next month when another new method comes out). Join me as I work through some of    the issues faced while creating Single Page Applications using ASP.NET and MVC5.    We’ll explore what’s new in Visual Studio 2013, MVC5 and WebAPI, and then look at    a couple of techniques for creating SPA applications in MVC using MVC partial pages    and using some of the popular libraries like Knockout and Ember. I’m sure we’ll    be able to cover all those topics in one hour, right? :)</p>

This session aims to shed some light from    the real world on how Git is different, why the differences matter, and introduce    some features and use cases you never knew you couldn't live without. Topics covered    will include interactive rebase, interactive add, reflog, bisect and more.</p>

        <p>    The entire web is married to JavaScript. That’s not the fact. Fact is the guys who    are cooking for the web, is crazy about JavaScript. Hence, you cannot imagine a    single website (desktop or mobile) without JavaScript. Saving the marriage is not    an option when your world is occupied by your better half in loading resources,    delicious libraries, fancy charts/ visualization, two way binding, interactions    with DOM, responsive U,I so and so on... When JavaScript do the core work like (grocery,    taking dogs to walk/ kids to child care, weekends/ vacation plan, marathon shopping)    CSS makes your site interesting. CSS performance is the silent killer that we always    ignore. The goal of this talk is not to save the marriage rather to make the marriage    most enjoyable, highly interesting and tremendously performing. High performance    doesn’t have to some miracle that somehow works. After this talk, you would be the    guy who rocks for high performance JavaScript and CSS. And you will believe, high    performance code could reusable, readable and maintainable.</p>

        <p>    Google Glass has acquired mindshare as the first viable mainstream commercial "wearable    computing" product. But for all the excitement (especially amongst the technorati),    there is a lot of fear and doubt. What's it like to wear this thing all day? What    can you do with it? What *can't* you do with it? When can I get one? How do I develop    for it? Will it make me blind and/or sterile? Join Wolf Loescher to discus the good,    the bad, and the the ugly about Google Glass.</p>

        <p>    How do you build games in HTML5? In this talk we will learn about the basics of    game development and how to apply it in a canvas based HTML5 game. We will be building    a simple game live on the screen by leveraging JavaScript and new HTML5 features.    We will learn about drawing to the HTML5 canvas, handling key input, maintaining    frame rate, the subtleties of performing rotations and translations, setting up    audio, sprite animations, basic game physics, and multiplayer support! I will also    discuss some lessons in game programming that I learned the hard way so that you    don’t have to. If you are interested in web game development, come learn about everything    you need to make your first game –from the basics to the advanced.</p>

        <p>    Django is a Python MVC web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. In this    presentation, we'll explore how Django exploits the principle of DRY and the ecosystem    that surrounds Python by building a simple polling application for voting on issues.    Django powers many well-know websites such as Instagram, Pinterest, PBS and Mozilla.    Don't worry if you've never used Python before... you'll be surprised how productive    you can be in Python with little knowledge.</p>

        <p>    You may be under the impression that Service Oriented Architecture means building    SOAP-based web services as a middleware for your application, which is painful and    difficult to manage long term. Come learn a better way to employ the true power    of SOA via asynchronous messaging with the NServiceBus, a .NET Enterprise Service    Bus. You will learn about the differences between different application and systems    integration options and architectural styles, and how a Service Bus architectural    style can help you to cut down the complexity of a system to deliver truly scalable    and manageable distributed solutions.</p>

        <p>    One of the most exciting technology improvements announced for iOS 7 was the new    JavaScriptCore framework. With this new system framework, developers can write JavaScript    code with full access to iOS platform APIs. This means that native UIKit applications,    games, and everything in between can now be written in JavaScript, without the addition    of a third party framework or missing out on rich platform APIs. After many years    in purgatory, JavaScript is now blessed and officially supported by Apple for usage    in native iOS apps. In this talk, we'll focus on what developers need to know to    take advantage of JavaScriptCore bindings in iOS 7. We will also explore where this    new technology fits in alongside existing JavaScript solutions for mobile development,    like Appcelerator's Titanium and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap). To demonstrate how this    new framework might be used, we will script a simple game using SpriteKit, the new    built-in 2D game framework in iOS 7. There are many exciting possible applications    of this technology, and I hope the JavaScript community takes full advantage of    them.</p>

        <p>    Anyone who has developed for the web has run into JavaScript. It is a language that    was first standardized right around the same year I graduated high school (1996).    After 10 years of developing applications with C#, I find myself missing certain    aspects of the .NET Framework and the C# language that I really wished existed in    JavaScript. This talk will go over several aspects of JavaScript from the perspective    of a C# guy. We will review tips and tricks to make life easier, software engineering    patterns to increase code quality and general guidelines to make JavaScript more    maintainable.</p>

        <p>    What is IOC? You’ve no doubt heard the term thrown around by seasoned developers.    They sing of its usefulness and power – but when you try to learn it, it all seems    to go over your head. That was me a few years ago. I finally made a concerted effort    to really learn IOC and see what all these smart people were raving about. In this    session, I will share my knowledge of IOC and try to help you understand why Inversion    of Control is as good as the alpha geeks say it is.</p>

        <p>    Are you writing JavaScript or CSS for a web application? Maybe you even compile    some CoffeeScript or SASS? Do you concatenate and minify your files? How about linting    them? And you run your unit tests every time you make a change, right? ...RIGHT!?    There's always been a lot of grunt work involved with frontend development but there    have never been great tools for improving your workflow as a developer. That is,    until Node.js came along and completely changed the game in terms of what is possible    to do on the server-side. Come see how GruntJS (a VERY useful Node.js module) can    make your life easier by taking care of most of that grunt work for you! Adhering    to best practices has never been easier. This session will also touch on Node.js,    NPM, PhantomJS, Bower, and more.</p>

        <p>    In this live coding demo, we’re going to start where most introduction Windows Phone    development tutorials leave off, which is: what do you do after you have your basic    app working? How do you leverage MVVM, add offline capability, cache data, handle    logging &amp; exceptions, and polish it for a great user experience? We’ll take an existing    basic application (mine, in fact) and enhance it while I share tips, tricks, and    gotchas related to building a fully realized Windows Phone app that will help you    level up your existing application and learn what it takes to build a real live    app.</p>

        <p>    Angular.JS from Google introduces a radically different way to build things for    the web with HTML and JavaScript. In this talk, we'll take a look at the basic and    most useful features of Angular as we build some simple apps and widgets we're already    familiar with using new techniques. We'll look at Angular's support for data binding,    services, directives, and testing. And we'll also talk about where Angular isn't    a good fit.</p>

        <p>    You may have seen the theoretical discussions of Reactive Extensions and heard about    the duality of IEnumerable and IObservable, but are still scratching your head to    know how and when to use them. In demo filled session, we'll cover a number of cases    where it makes sense to consider RX to declaratively compose complex operations    over observable sequences in an elegant LINQ like syntax. We may even have some    chocolate induced audience participation along the way.</p>

        <p>    With OpenID, OAuth, Security Token Services, Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication    and many other approach's the security story for the ASP.Net Web API is a confusing    one to say the least. In this session we will talk about the various approaches    to securing your Web API's as well as choosing the right method for your situation.    In doing so we will cover authentication and authorization, cryptography and the    various extension points of the ASP.NET Web API Framework that can help us create    a production grade service.</p>

        <p>    Single Page Application (SPA) with WebAPI, Knockout, and Breeze. Many of us have    been using AJax for a long time to make our web applications modern and responsive.    In this presentation I will demonstrate how to develop your entire UI with client    side javascript, css, and html, using WebAPI for back end database interaction and    middle tier logic. This presentation uses a combination of javascript libraries,    including JQuery, Knockout, BreezeJS, History.JS, and Q-Js. These libraries make    writing SPA applications easier than ever, with client side data binding and observable    javascript objects among other features.

        <p>    One common misconception regarding Microsoft’s Business Rules Engine (BRE) is that    you need BizTalk to use it. Actually, you can call the Rules Engine from any .NET    code. In this session, we’ll show you how to create a policy in the Business Rules    Composer, deploy it to the Rules Engine, and then use Plain Old C# Objects (POCOs)    to execute it. We’ll also include a very brief overview of BizTalk 2013 and how    the BRE works. The demos will use Visual Studio 2012 and the BizTalk 2013 Business    Rules Engine.</p>
