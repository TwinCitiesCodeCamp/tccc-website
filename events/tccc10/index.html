        <p>    Visual Studio took over 43 MILLION lines of code to write – it's big. Really BIG.    There is no way that a single developer can know everything about Visual Studio    that will be useful. That's where this session comes in. We'll cover a plethora    of shortcuts, strategies, hidden features and freeware that will save you a gigantic    amount time when developing your .Net application with Visual Studio. Beginners    and advanced programmers alike will walk away saying, "I didn't know you could to    that!"</p>

        <p>    A year ago, I hopped on the mobile/smartphone band wagon, by picking up a Motorola    Droid. The original/milestone Droid phone from Motorola. I've been picking up learning    about "mobile" development and what it means to business and technologist in my    limited time, juggling multiple projects. The first thing you are faced, when you    want to explore mobile development, is what platform do you want to target? Apple/IOS,    Android, Blackberry, WebOS. As a systems integrator, with a number of technologies    under my belt, the question was how to you reach more than one platform. What I    discovered, is the web based frameworks and html5 are starting to emerge. Yes, these    frameworks are still a little on the bleeding edge of things, but isn't that what    all the fun is about? Get a peek into some of the emerging frameworks in this area.    These frameworks include jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Titanium, SproutCore, PhoneGap,    Rhodes are a few of the leading/bleeding frameworks that let you target multiple    platforms. This won't be a deep dive, but will be a mid-level overview of some of    these frameworks and my journey.</p>

        <p>    SpecFlow is an open-source Behavior-Driven Development testing tool for .NET that    lets you write specifications using 100%-Cucumber-compatible Gherkin syntax. It    integrates with Visual Studio, providing file templates to speed your testing efforts.    It also integrates seamlessly with the Visual Studio debugger, so that you can set    breakpoints in the SpecFlow-based tests. It can be used in conjunction with WatiN,    an open-source library for automating web browsers using .NET, and WebAii, Telerik's    free testing framework for Web and Silverlight applications. This session will give    a brief overview of the tools, highlighting each tool's role in facilitating acceptance    testing. The second part of the session will demonstrate the usage of the tools    in testing real web and Silverlight applications.</p>

        <p>    This session covers the more complex debugging scenarios in Visual Studio including    to address debugging more complex scenarios. We'll start with setting breakpoints    (absolute, conditional, and advanced). Next, we'll discuss capturing debug output    with the System.Diagnostic.Debug statement, how and when to do tracing and logging,    debugging web pages, and analyzing log files with parsing and filtering. We'll move    to debugging performance issues using timers within the code and using Visual Studio    performance analysis. Finally, we'll finish with dealing with memory leaks; what    are the typical causes and solutions, using the .NET garbage collector to hunt down    the problems, and using SOS to poke around in memory during execution.</p>

        <p>    Manual testing of web applications is expensive and repetitive. Often the QA staff    does not have the capacity or the project schedule does not include time to do a    complete regression test of applications for each release. Often when the project    gets behind the first thing to reduce time on is testing. Using automated web testing    in Team System 2010 can eliminate much of the repetitive manual validation of web    sites. Not only can it exercise your web application, but it generates really good    reports to show to management.</p><ul>    <li>Walk through of creating a simple web test against a simple web application</li>    <li>Making sure your web test is data driven and maintainable</li>    <li>Creating custom web test plug ins using c#</li>    <li>Coded Web Tests</li>    <li>Load Testing with your web tests</li></ul>

        <p>    As more and more web applications integrate with third-party APIs and other external    data, processing those external resources in the background more and more important.    A simple job runner is a great start, however as your load increases, you very quickly    outgrew that simplistic queuing system. We will cover where getting started using    Resque and Redis, how to test your jobs, when it makes sense to use Resque, implementations    of Resque in other languages, and look how I've used Resque.</p>

        <p>    WCF is rapidly gaining popularity as a tool to create modern web services, but can    it help you accomplish more? In actuality, WCF is a framework designed to help you    develop robust service oriented applications and systems. Many developers find themselves    suddenly tasked with building a system using WCF and can become overwhelmed with    the scope of the WCF Framework. Fortunately, WCF is easily embraced when theres    an overall understanding of how the capabilities are organized. In this presentation    we'll first cover the capabilities of WCF and how they align to currently well known    integration strategies. Next, we'll consider some common challenges you'll encounter    when developing enterprise applications and systems with WCF. Lastly, we'll learn    a few of the common scenarios you'll find yourself working with in the real world.</p>

        <p>    CSLA .NET is one of the most widely used development frameworks for .NET, Silverlight,    and Windows Phone 7. MonoDroid is a version of mono for Android. Mono is an open-source    implementation of Microsoft .NET. In this session Rocky will discuss his experiences    in porting CSLA 4 to MonoDroid for Android. You'll learn what the MonoDroid development    experience feels like, how compatible it is with .NET, Silverlight, and WP7, and    what issues were overcome to get CSLA 4 working on this different platform.</p>

        <p>    The XBox Kinect device has become just as popular among programmers as it has among    gamers. From air-guitar apps to user interfaces that resemble scenes from the movie    Minority Report, programmers have been creating unique and innovative apps with    the Kinect since it was released in late 2010. In this session we'll talk about    how to develop Kinect-based apps for Windows 7 with managed .NET code. The session    will cover the foundations of what you need to build Kinect apps such as drivers,    libraries, detecting and focusing on a user, hand tracking, and simple gestures    such as swiping and pushing. We'll also get in to applying these concepts to Windows    technologies such as WPF and show live examples of Kinect being used in real apps    for real-world scenarios.</p>

        <p>    Developing a native mobile app sounded cool, but looking at the developer tools    for iPhone development made me sick. The launch of WP 7 last year opened up a world    of opportunity for Microsoft developers, and we were ready to jump on the bandwagon.    This presentation will provide an overview of the application and a behind the scenes    look at the approach we took to develop the application. In addition, we will highlight    the phone controls and phone capabilities that were used as well as discuss lessons    learned along the way.</p>

        <p>    Building reliable, scalable, maintainable distributed applications is next to impossible    without the right tools. NServiceBus is an open-source .NET framework that will    help you to do just that. This session will focus on code and cover the fundamentals    of NServiceBus development, including one-way messaging, publish and subscribe,    implementing long-running business processes, and scaling out.</p>

        <p>    Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library from Microsoft that allows you to write LINQ    queries to compose events and asynchronous operations into simple yet powerful constructs.    Rx is packed with useful functionality that allows you to get a lot done with very    little effort. This session will go over some common Rx functions, like Throttle    and Zip, and demonstrate how easily they can be combined with various events to    enable you to create superior user experiences.</p>

If the vast majority of the enterprise code    you already have is in C#, why learn develop in Objective C when the language you    have the majority of your experience in is waiting for you. This session will walk    through an application that is built to run on both the iPad and the iPod/iPhone    platform, utilizing enterprise web services and approximating a standard enterprise    application.</p>

        <p>    In January, Microsoft released ASP.Net MVC 3. With it came a brand new view engine    called "Razor." Razor was created to address some of the headaches involved in developing    with MVC 1 and 2. In this session, we'll go over previous view engines, design goals    for Razor and a breakdown of Razor's most important features.</p>

        <p>    The Reactive Extensions (Rx) library is a new framework from Microsoft Research    for reactive and asynchronous programming. Why should you care? Because it's the    best innovation to come to .NET since LINQ: it will simplify your code, fix memory    leaks, institute tikkun olam, and infuse your code with all kinds of techno-zen    awesomeness. You'll walk away from this talk with just enough knowledge to be dangerous.    Oh, and you'll also grok some very practical ways to improve your code using Rx.</p>

Every language has strings, arrays,    conditionals, and evaluation, and by now, everyone's sick of "build a CRUD app in    15 minutes" demos. Every language has its own special qualities that set it apart,    and this talk focuses what makes Ruby different and special. We'll cover seven advanced    language features and techniques, and we'll demonstrate how we use those to solve    everyday problems. We'll talk about message passing, extending core language features,    lambdas, and we'll even write a little code that writes code. If you've looked at    Ruby and thought "What's the point?" then this talk is for you.</p>

        <p>    In this session you will be introduced to the new Android 3.0 release, Honeycomb.    This release of Android is targeted at tablet development, but is compatible with    previous versions of Android. The new features of Android 3.0 will be discussed    with some code samples that will outline the new features and how to use them. You'll    learn about the new action bar, fragments, new home screen widgets and the system    bar and how the new tablet emulator works.</p>

        <p>    Facebook, Yahoo and others have decided there is too much value in the data generated    by their users to delete it. Ever! To store and process this data they are turning    to Apache Hadoop. In this presentation we will answer the following questions. When    is Hadoop appropriate? What are people using Hadoop for? How does Hadoop fit into    our existing environment? Finally we will investigate the internals of a sample    Hadoop MapReduce job.</p>

        <p>    Many software engineers consider "shell scripting" to be a dark art best left to    system administrators. In the distributed computing world basic shell-scripting    knowledge can save you hours of time, per week. In this session we will cover the    basics of shell scripting by diving right into working solutions, like processing    logs using shell in a Hadoop cluster, and monitoring for race conditions, gathering    the required artifacts once the condition is hit. In addition to learn shell scripting    specific structures such as assigning the output of a command to a variable and    chaining basic utilities together to accomplish a complex task. Finally, every attendee    will receive free shell access to a sandbox I run for users to learn shell!</p>

        <p>    Grails is an advanced and innovative open source web application platform that delivers    new levels of developer productivity by applying principles like Convention over    Configuration. Grails naturally complements Java application development since it    is built on Spring and based on Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java platform.    This session will start with a brief overview of the exciting Grails web application    framework. Topics covered include the structure of a Grails application, data querying    and persistence, validation, controllers, Groovy Server Pages (GSPs) and tag libraries.    The second part of the session will be a hands-on demonstration, showing the agility    and speed of development that the Grails framework is known for.</p>

        <p>    jQuery is an extremely popular and fast growing Javascript Library that focuses    on cross-browser support and simplifying the act of writing client-side scripting.    This small Javascript library packs a big punch for HTML developers looking to add    increased client-side functionality to their web sites. jQuery features simple HTML    DOM element selection and traversal, event binding, CSS manipulations, animation,    and AJAX functionality. jQuery also boasts an extensibility aspect with a very large    implementation base. You can easily find a jQuery library to achieve many different    web functions that you may already be looking for. This presentation will focus    on getting you started with jQuery development and how you can use it with HTML,    CSS, and Images to create some very neat effects with relatively little effort.</p>

        <p>    CSLA .NET is one of the most widely used open source development frameworks for    the .NET platform, and it has been available since before .NET shipped nearly a    decade ago. During this time Microsoft has changed .NET itself, as well as the various    UI technologies supported by .NET. And they've introduced new platforms such as    Silverlight and Windows Phone 7. More recently, CSLA .NET has been ported to the    open source mono, along with the MonoTouch and MonoDroid platforms. Join framework    creator Rockford Lhotka as he discusses the challenges involved in building, maintaining,    and evolving a large and widely used framework over a period of many years and through    all these platform changes.</p>

        <p>    The Model-View-View Model pattern has become the de facto architecture for applications    written with WPF and Silverlight for good reason. It makes WPF and Silverlight applications    easier to write and maintain but sometimes it can be difficult to understand how    to get a task done or how the pieces all fit together. This session will go over    the guiding principles of MVVM, explore the responsibilities of each layer, and    explain the differences between MVVM and MVC. I will focus on the common problems    teams run into when developing an application and how you can solve them by understanding    the "How?" and "Why?" of MVVM as well as the "What?" you may have seen before.</p>

        <p>    Have you read about Test-Driven Development, but uncertain of how it would really    work? Would you like to see how real practitioners discuss requirements and build    tests? In this session, two developers will pair to solve a software problem using    Test-Driven development live. You will see them discuss their approach and build    their tests unscripted. Later, anyone in the audience will be invited up to continue    the Dojo and learn TDD hands on.</p>

        <p>    For many of us, writing code isn't just what we do for money; it's something we    love to do and share with others. One of the best ways to share that passion is    through writing. In this talk, we'll explore the world of writing and publishing    content for programmers. We'll explore the writing and editorial processes, including    how to really connect with your audience, and we'll go over some tools and techniques    you can use to organize your writing and produce something real, useful, and unique.    Finally, we'll talk about what it takes to make a great book proposal and what it    takes to get the word out about your writing.

        <p>    In this overly-ambitious session, Kurt Christensen will censor neither his language    nor his opinions in a feeble attempt to distill 8 years of good and bad experiences    as an agile coach into a single hour, telling you absolutely everything you need    to know to make your next project succeed in magnificent fashion, with rainbows    and flying unicorns! How's *that* for some "agile" snake oil?</p>

        <p>    NodeJS is a Server Side JavaScript (SSJS) implementation built off the Google Chrome    V8 JavaScript engine. It is grown considerably in popularity since its initial public    release a little over a year ago. Some have called 2011, the "Year of Server Side    JavaScript." Why? Is it just a fad? What does it offer different from other server    side languages and frameworks? What makes it stand out? In this talk, we will be    discussing the answers to those questions as we look at design philosophy behind    NodeJS. We will also look into its implementation and some demo applications. The    goal is for you to come away with a clear understanding of what NodeJS is, what    problems it tries to solve, and how it could be used in your application stack.</p>
