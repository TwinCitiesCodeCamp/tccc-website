        <p>    You may or may not have noticed lately but Microsoft is moving your cheese. WCF    is out and ASP.NET Web API is in. Windows Forms is out and "Modern UI" (Formerly    "Metro") is in. During this session we'll start by designing our database schema    in SQL Server. Next, we'll expose our data via an HTTP API using Web API. Then we'll    tie it all together by writing a Windows 8 Modern UI-style application that consumes    our data and makes it available to the user. If we want to finish we'll need to    do away with the pleasantries and write code right out of the gate.</p>

        <p>    Outages happen. Software has bugs, hardware fails, people make mistakes. In the    increasingly complex world we live in, the demand for systems that can adapt to    failures is becoming more important every day. Cloud Computing is helping show us    how to solve these problems. In this session we will discuss some of the lessons    learned in the cloud and how we can apply them to software no matter where its running.</p>

        <p>    Sure you host your application on IIS, but are you truly leveraging all the platform    has to offer? In this session you will learn about key extensions to IIS to simplify    working with your web application. Manage a web farm, handle URL rewriting, implement    application load balancing, sync content and configuration between servers, or use    shared configuration. Learn how to manage databases through IIS manager, create    FTP sites, and script common tasks with PowerShell. You will leave this session    having a new arsenal of tools for working with IIS.</p>

        <p>    The world is changing fast, and Microsoft is committed to the new Windows Runtime    (WinRT) development platform on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and perhaps elsewhere.    The CSLA .NET framework is one of the most widely used open source development frameworks    for the Microsoft .NET framework, and CSLA 4 version 4.5 supports .NET 4.5 and WinRT    development. In this session you will learn how to create applications leverage    CSLA .NET to encapsulate all business, validation, and authorization logic so that    logic is available to applications written using WFP, ASP.NET, and the new WinRT    platform. Those WinRT applications can then deploy to Intel and ARM-based Windows    8 devices such as tablets, ultrabooks, laptops, and desktop computers.</p>

        <p>    One of the hot industry trends right now is the movement towards development for    phones and tablets. There are a lot of corporate developers with experience developing    on the Microsoft platforms, and MVC in particular. The ASP.NET MVC4 Framework is    out now and has many new features, including support for mobile devices. In this    session, you'll build on your existing MVC skills and leverage those new features    to deliver smart websites that adapt to different devices. We'll discuss how to    build mobile-friendly web pages using MVC4 and jQuery.Mobile, we'll review some    of the new MVC4 features, and also hit on a few other topics that are covered in    more detail in the speaker's book "Delivering Mobile-Friendly WebSites with MVC4".</p>

        <p>    The web has been evolving toward single page applications for a while now, and now    that they're here, a lot of tools and frameworks have been popping up to accomodate    their development. In this talk, we'll go through the history of the evolution of    single page applications and go over some of the more popular tools and frameworks    that people are using to build them, including Backbone.js, Node.js, Upshot.js,    Knockout.js and Microsoft's Single-Page Application project type. Given the topic    and angle of this talk, we will just HAVE to play buzzword bingo (I'll bring the    game cards).</p>

        <p>    Whether you want to admit it or not, the decisions that you make as a developer    greatly influence the final design of your application's user interface. It doesn't    matter if you're working with a designer, or you're a one-man A-Team, there are    some very easy and powerful things that you can do to ensure that the final product    is intuitive, usable and (gasp!) beautiful.

        <p>    Is your system bleeding valuable business data? Regular HTTP-based web and WCF services    are unreliable. Server crashes and deadlocks cause data to disappear. NServiceBus    is a .NET Enterprise Service Bus framework that will help you correctly apply the    principles of service oriented architecture to stop it. And yes, it works with Azure    too. Learn the basics of asynchronous messaging, publish/subscribe, and long-running    workflows (sagas) and how you can use them to build a more reliable and maintainable    distributed system.</p>

        <p>    Everything has been gamified today; the leafy tree on your hybrid car, credit card    points, electric bills, and the slew of retail rewards programs. Then three are    games themselves, grandmas and toddlers are playing massively multi-player online    games. Games are huge parts of our lives, even if we don’t realize it. In this session    we will explore how game theory drives behavior. What are key gaming concepts that    we can leverage in our applications? How do we satisfy different gamer demographics    when building actual games? The games industry is in a huge shift of both decline    and growth. Where is gaming going? This session will strive to create a greater    appreciation for the complexity of game theory and the behavior it drives.</p>

        <p>    Knockout.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces.    Getting started with Knockout is easy, but as your application grows in complexity,    it can be challenging to keep your code clean and performing optimally. In this    session, we will talk about the tools, tricks, and techniques that you can use to    take your Knockout application to the next level. Topics will include extending    Knockout's structures, creating custom bindings, taking advantage of some lesser-known    Knockout APIs and avoiding common performance issues.</p>

        <p>    Two clicks, zero passwords. Come learn how to make sign in faster, safer, and easier    for your users. How? By adding support for Mozilla Persona, a cross-browser, decentralized    authentication system that completely eliminates per-site passwords, without any    developer lock-in. See how Persona compares to OpenID, and watch as a demo site    gets converted from passwords to Persona in less than 50 lines of code, starting    with ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN password;</p>

        <p>    Windows 8 marks a complete shift in design principles for the Windows platform.    To stay relevant as a developer on the Windows platform, you have to learn to implement    the new Windows 8 design principles. In this session, we will cover what you need    to know about what has changed and what hasn't. We will look at how you, the developer,    can leverage these design principles from the perspective you know best: the code.</p>

        <p>    At this session you can come and see an overview of what Windows Workflow Foundation    4 (WWF4) is with examples and pointers to more information for you to explore on    your own. WWF4 is made of designers, flow control, messaging, variables, collections    and and places to inject your own custom code. It is a developer tool but opens    the door to having your customers understand your system and processes more clearly.    You will leave with a better understanding of whether workflow in general and WWF4    in particular would be be a good fit for your purposes.</p>

        <p>    The C++ Renaissance is a time of renewed interest in C++; particularly by young    developers. Interest in C++ has increased as trends of using “modern” language semantics,    and object-oriented programming concepts play a bigger role in C++ applications.    In this presentation; you will learn what has changed in C++ since win32, and how    C++ can be used for creating abstract data models, and even (GASP!) cross-platform    software development! If we have time I might also go into C++AMP at the end of    the presentation.</p>

MongoDB promises greater flexibility and scalability compared to relational    (SQL) data stores and has backed that claim up with a growing list of high profile    deployments. But how does a dev steeped in .NET &amp; SQL Server go about figuring out    if it's right for their project?

Whether you're a Photoshop    guru, or don't even own a Mac, we can still make valuable contributions to ensure    our digital assets are crisp and professional. In this talk, we'll look at some    basic command-line tools for creating, modifying, and managing images, and look    at how we can manage them properly on the web. We'll play with sprites, responsive    images for these new retina displays, and techniques for optimizing performance    on lower bandwidth connections and mobile web.</p>

        <p>    Up until the last few years, it was completely acceptable to design/develop a new    website for one size of monitor. But with the release of the iPhone, iPad and other    mobile devices, we've witnessed the beginning of a mobile revolution. By the end    of this year, over 50% of Americans will use their phone or tablet as their primary    web browsing device. The question is, are the sites that you are creating ready?    In this talk, I'll talk about reasons why responsive is the best way to develop    new websites, as well as the best techniques I've discovered after a year of full    time development of responsive websites.</p>

        <p>    In this presentation we'll look at using the template method design pattern and    a fluent interface to create ordering criteria for sorting algorithms. We'll also    look at using the strategy design pattern to make the choice of sorting algorithm    easy to modify. Next, we'll throw in some IComparers, IComparables and events. Then,    we'll wrap it up by packaging the code in extension methods and demonstrate its    uses with LINQ and lambdas.</p>

        <p>    More and more of our code is moving into the web; and into JavaScript. But we quickly    find ourselves in a nested mess of jQuery callbacks, tangled dependencies, and global    events. In this session we will transform, step-by-step, a "classic" JavaScript    application into a tested, structured, and modular application using QUnit, Sinon,    Backbone, and Require.js.</p>

        <p>    As we move more and more important code from the server onto the client, we need    to ensure that code is well designed and well-tested. A simple mistake can cause    the entire user interface to fail in spectacular ways. This book will give you the    grounding you need to develop test-first client-side code so you can avoid messes    and have more confidence in your applications. In this talk, you'll learn to use    CoffeeScript and the Jasmine testing library to develop solid, testable client-side    code. We'll cover how to create encapsulated code, how to stub out remote calls,    and how to automate the test suite so it can run automatically in the background    or as part of a continuous integration server. If you write client side code but    need to know how to test it, this talk is for you.</p>

        <p>    Can your company afford to take a $6 million hit? That’s how much Target paid in    2008 to settle a lawsuit claiming its website was not accessible to the blind. Avoid    having your company become a Target by learning more about this growing topic in    a compact 60 minutes. In the first half, Ian will focus on the what and why of accessibility;    in the second half, he’ll show you how to use JavaScript and WAI-ARIA to make your    website more accessible. A solid understanding of HTML and JavaScript is recommended.</p>

        <p>    The Hells Angels motorcycle club is one of the most famously known motorcycle clubs.    When you read about their infamous violence or run-ins with the law you rarely think    about them and how they use a computer or surf the internet. When professionals    talk about usability, it’s hard not to think of people similar to themselves - but    what if your customers are not "typical" web users? How do you build for them or    discover how they interact with your site? In this talk Keith and Tim share their    real-world experience managing <a href="http://www.jpcycles.com" target="_blank">jpcycles.com</a>    (one of the world's 500 largest retail websites) and how they are working to identify    their customers' needs and adjusting their site to make it more friendly to their    motorcycle riding customers. Tim and Keith will share openly and honestly about    the tools they are using daily to maximize the experience and uncover "truth" in    their customers. Interestingly great website design is much aligned with the Hells    Angels motto: "When we do right, nobody remembers. When we do wrong, nobody forgets."</p>

        <p>    Are you an HTML/JavaScript developer? Did you know this means you are also a Windows    8 Metro developer? Come see how you can leverage your existing web development skills    and build a complete Windows 8 application that will be “Windows Store ready”. Starting    with first principles, we will move into building an application that leverages    WinJS, Contracts, local storage, and more.</p>
