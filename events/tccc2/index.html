        <p>    Microsoft .NET 3.0 is here, and it includes WCF, WPF and WF. Learn how these technologies    are used and supported by Rocky's CSLA .NET framework. See how WCF can be a drop-in    replacement for Remoting, web services or Enterprise Services, and how you can use    business objects with WCF to build service-oriented applications. Get a look at    how to use business objects behind WPF forms to get the interactivity of Windows    Forms, and the flexibility of using markup (XAML) to design your pages. And see    how to create workflow activities using business objects, so your workflows have    all the power and capabilities offered by CSLA .NET.</p>

        <p>    This presentation will describe Kerberos at a high level, and then go into detail    on how to setup Delegation and Kerberos authentication using SQL Server, IIS and    a client. Additionally we may delve into delegation across two SQL instances and    a client. The presentation will include a review of the tools necessary to setup    delegation and Kerberos and the debugging techniques used to resolve Kerberos authentication    problems. If you are looking for a way to improve your security, eliminate the need    for SQL authentication and understand the tools needed to do this, then this presentation    is for you. If you know what a double-hop is and could never quite find a way around    the problem before, then this presentation is for you. And, if you ever wondered    how to get a client app authenticated through IIS to SQL server and maintain auditing,    then this presentation is for you.</p>

        <p>    Are you constantly troubleshooting business processes embedded within and between    your custom applications? Would you like to learn more about those processes so    that you can improve them and spend less time troubleshooting them? If you answered    yes to either of these questions then BizTalk's Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)    might be for you. BAM is used to instrument your processes, from both a technical    and business perspective, so that you can enhance the processes as well as alert    users and technical staff when certain conditions are reached. This session will    introduce you to BAM through presentation and coding demonstrations. The focus will    not be on BizTalk itself but rather on its BAM features which can be used from beyond    BizTalk with a single BizTalk license.</p>

        <p>    There's more to Windows Vista than Glass and Sidebar. Learn what Vista has to offer    you as the developer, what you can take advantage of to enhance your customers user    experience and how you leverage many of these new features using the tools you have    today. This presentation is more about the features in Windows Vista, how you can    leverage them and how you can interact with them using interoperability; as many    of the new features in Vista are not .NET native (such as Aero/DWM, Windows Experience    Index information, etc.). Some examples show how to "skin" the .NET 2.0 TreeView    control to look and feel like the Vista Explorer / Windows Mail applications and    modify the behavior of a WinForms menu to show and hide similar to Windows Vista    counterparts.</p>

        <p>    Charles Darwin had an idea: that over time, species of animals adapted; evolved.    Later, in the 1950s, computer scientists thought , "Hey, why not model natural selection    on a computer?" With that, genetic algorithms were born! This talk will introduce    (softly, I promise) genetic algorithms... applications of genetic algorithms, and    hopefully some takeaway concepts and frameworks so you can try your own.</p>

        <p>    The Microsoft Patterns and Practices group created the Web Service Software Factory    (WSSF) to assist developers and architects quickly and consistently build services    which follow sound architecture principles and design patterns. WSSF helps automate    common tasks such as project layout, message design, service interface design, message    validation, and domain object/data contract translation. In this session, we will    build a simple application with WSSF (WCF version) to demonstrate its usage, strengths    and weaknesses.</p>

        <p>    Reflection is a powerful way to dynamically inspect assembies at run-time to determine    the structure of its contents, invoke methods, and change private field values (among    other interesting tricks). But it doesn't stop there - .NET gives you the power    to create code at run-time via its reflection infrastructure as well. In this presentation,    I'll cover the essentials of the System.Reflection namespace (along with the changes    that were added in 2.0), how to emit code at run-time, and other libraries that    go far beyond what .NET can currently provide (FxCop's CCI library for introspection    and Mono.Cecil for full assembly reading/writing).</p>

        <p>    Subsonic is an elegant Active Record implementation for the .Net Framework that    can save you significant development time. It uses a powerful query engine to pull    data into well designed generic collections. At the end of the day you can use more    energy in the design of your pages and their business logic since your focus is    not on building yet another data access layer. I'll walk you through how to get    started with SubSonic to get the most out of the tool, show you how to go beyond    the basics and will demonstrate how to rapidly build out a web site.</p>

        <p>    Many Windows developers have used Visual SourceSafe their entire career. Most of    us know there are other source code control tools out there but have never had any    exposure to them. In this session I will introduce Subversion, a free, open source    version control system. First we will take a look at what tools are available for    use with Subversion (command line, TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN). Next we will cover some    basic concepts about versioning models and Subversion's implementation and then    walk though how a developer works with Subversion on a daily basis. After looking    at daily developer usage we will dive into some more advanced topics Subversion    administrators will need to understand and power users will want to know about including    branching, merging, creating and applying patches, repository setup and structuring,    and integration with issue tracking systems.</p>

        <p>    Unit testing is a critical activity in producing quality software. Developers should    apply unit testing in parallel to the development of the software. Because unit    testing is so important, it should be easy to perform unit testing. The developer    should be able to focus on the "what" the unit tests demonstrates rather than the    "how" to demonstrate the result. There are a fairly large number of unit testing    tools that can greatly simplify the unit testing process. Many of these tools are    free. This session would include a "dash" of unit testing philosophy plus a lot    of code that demonstrates the use the "core" unit testing harnesses such as NUnit,    MbUnit, and MsTest as well as related testing tools such as NUnitForms and NUnitASP.    The session will also address the use of tools to replace dependent elements with    dummy units, stub units, and mock units. The types of units to be tested will include:    Logic, Window Forms, Web Pages, Databases, XML Files, JavaScript, and Ajax functionality.</p>

        <p>    Ask a Rails developer how she would tackle a simple business problem. She'll tell    you. Put your database scripts here, your functional tests here, html markup here,    controller logic here, your unit tests here, and put your model here. To validate    your model, add a few lines here. And because of some simple and reasonable naming    conventions, it all plays well together. Ask a .Net developer how to tackle the    same business problem. She'll start thinking. Well, the UI seems pretty obvious,    but from there it gets difficult. You might start by doing the "simplest thing that    can possibly work," and drag a dataset onto your screen. But where do you put your    database scripts? And how do you test your business logic? Or your UI controller    logic? And how do you name things? If this developer has been around for a while,    she probably has a few favorite patterns in her toolbox. Maybe she's even got some    of the pieces covered with reusable code libraries. But she doesn't have a solid,    well-tested, common framework for completing even a simple business scenario. She    should! In this presentation, we'll describe how Rails removes many of the common    barriers to getting real work done – and discuss how the .Net community might do    the same.</p>

        <p>    As we all know, the application/database relationship domain is one of the hardest,    most time consuming, and complex areas of applications. iBatis is one solution that    is filling the gap and making these relationships as painless as possible. iBatis    consists of two pieces. One which allows robust mapping between database and application    domain objects. As well as another piece that provides abstraction of the data access    layer all together. iBatis is a good greenfield development tool, however, it's    even more useful in legacy system additions and rewrites, when connecting to existing    databases where the schema can't be changed.</p>
