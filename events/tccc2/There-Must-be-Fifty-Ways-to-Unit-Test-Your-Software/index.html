      <p>    Unit testing is a critical activity in producing quality software. Developers should    apply unit testing in parallel to the development of the software. Because unit    testing is so important, it should be easy to perform unit testing. The developer    should be able to focus on the "what" the unit tests demonstrates rather than the    "how" to demonstrate the result. There are a fairly large number of unit testing    tools that can greatly simplify the unit testing process. Many of these tools are    free. This session would include a "dash" of unit testing philosophy plus a lot    of code that demonstrates the use the "core" unit testing harnesses such as NUnit,    MbUnit, and MsTest as well as related testing tools such as NUnitForms and NUnitASP.    The session will also address the use of tools to replace dependent elements with    dummy units, stub units, and mock units. The types of units to be tested will include:    Logic, Window Forms, Web Pages, Databases, XML Files, JavaScript, and Ajax functionality.</p>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Jon Stonecash is a senior consultant at Magenic Technology. Jon Stonecash has worked    in software development for much longer than he would like to admit. In that time    Jon has had the opportunity to make most of the serious software development mistakes    at least once. He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different    assembly languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.    He has survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about    databases and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business    logic. He is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development    process. Jon can be reached at jons@magenic.com.</p>
