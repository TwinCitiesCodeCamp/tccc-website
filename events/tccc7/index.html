          <p>    Building an app using XAML is different from both earlier Windows and web development    models. While there's still room for the MVC and MVP design patterns, the unique    capabilities of XAML mean that the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern is    often a better option. In this session you'll get a basic understanding of the MVVM    design pattern itself, and more importantly will see practical examples of its use    in building Silverlight and WPF applications.</p>

          <p>    In this session the audience will be introduced to the Spark view engine. The Spark    view engine is an alternative view engine for the ASP.NET MVC and MonoRail frameworks.    The idea of Spark is to allow html to dominate the flow and to allow the code to    fit seamlessly into it. We will delve into creating an ASP.NET MVC app with Spark,    Visual Studio Intellisense integration, and finally wrap things up by unit testing    a Spark view for acceptance testing. To actively participate in this session an    understanding of ASP.NET MVC is advised.</p>

These aren't urban myths but rather typical stories    that make the news every couple months. Is your company one database failure from    collapse? In this session, we'll go over the basis of backups. And also go over    the basics and best practices in creating a backup and recovery strategy.</p>

          <p>    ASP.Net MVC (Model View Controller) is one the new shiny technologies from Microsoft.    We will take a quick tour of the M, V, and C of MVC. While the Controllers and the    Models are very nice, the real fun is with the View Engines. That's right! ASP.NET    MVC supports a gaggle of different view engines. We will take a look at a representative    set of view engines (ASP.NET, Spark, and NHAML in some detail) and a quick "fly    by" of other (NVelocity and Brail). We will look at the good and bad of the coding    experience, the debugging experience, and the (dreaded) maintenance experience.    All of this will be useful input to the selection of a view engine for your next    project.</p><p>    The secret is that the selection does not have to be exclusive. Fun Fact: you can    use multiple view engines in the same application. Funner (OK, Even More Fun) Fact:    you can even use multiple view engines on the same web page. Come and see how to    make the magic happen. More goodies: see how to write your own view engine for fun    and profit; if I told you how easy it was, you might think it was a scam.</p><p>    But wait! there is more: in our "Bait and Switch" department, you can see how to    switch the view that you that you use in order to support mobile browsers. You can    even switch view engines on the fly. Learn how to log data for a subset of web pages    (determined by values in your application configuration file) by using a different    View Engine. Bring up your mastery of this dynamite technique at your next social    gathering and see how many admiring glances you get.</p><p>    And there will be unit testing. Yes, even the HTML produced by a view can be unit    tested. Sprinkle a little pixie dust on the view, chant "separation of concerns"    three times, and be able to verify that goodness of the incoming model has been    transformed into even more wonderful HTML. How cool is that?</p>

          <p>    Come learn about Ruby, and how it's much more than Rails. Ruby is a dynamic, fully    object-oriented language that borrows from Perl, Smalltalk, and LISP, but provides    a clean, simple syntax usable by hobbiests, but enough power to be used by some    of the most hardcore metaprogrammers in the world. Ruby has caught the attention    of Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, and Sun, powers sites like Yellowpages.com and Hulu,    and is an absolute joy to work with. In this presentation, you'll learn the fundamentals    of Ruby, and you'll see it in action as we build a simple web service using the    Sinatra microframework, a static web site with StaticMatic, and we'll test a web    site using Cucumber and our browser. Ruby is a lot more than Rails, so come learn    about it today!</p>

It allows, without    any robotics parts, visual feedback of algorithms for a variety of robotic platforms.    In this talk, we will walk through some of the more interesting features of the    Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio, both the Express version and the Academic/Pro    version. In addition, we will work through a simple example project utilizing the    Visual Programming Language 2008 Express environment and a LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robot    as well as demo a solution for the Sumo robotics challenge from the 2009 Imagine    Cup.</p>

          <p>    Creating a rich user experience involves diving into some unique challenges. How    do you work with data from various sources? How do you take advantage of modern    media elements? What can you do to integrate all these things into an application    that works? XAML provides a powerful schema for approaching the next generation    of rich interactive applications both on the PC and on the Internet. In this session,    we look at the programming model and tools that developers and designers can leverage    to build these true next-generation experiences for consumers and business, and    we demonstrate how to use XAML to build rich interactive applications using XAML    and Microsoft .NET. We explore how to use Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft    Expression Blend to create applications and compelling UI using XAML markup, code,    controls, and file I/O. We also discuss networking, how to retrieve data from a    Web service, and various other aspects of building Silverlight applications.</p>

          <p>    Microsoft has embraced the popular jQuery open source JavaScript library, which    is already used by many major web sites. jQuery provides a very productive enivornment    for client side programming in JavaScript. It takes advantage of existing knowledge    of CSS selector syntax to offer a powerful and efficient alternative to the DOM.    The use of operation chaining and implicit iteration lead to a very compact and    productive syntax. The library is very lean at a mere 15K, yet provides a strong    base and a great extensibility model which has led to a large number of plugin extensions    to simplify web development. The session will review how to use the library for    very useful features such as watermarks, avoiding browser inconsistencies, and making    AJAX calls to the server. Several plug ins will be demonstrated which provide stunning    client experiences with as little as 1 line of code! We will also study how to extend    the library with our own custom utility funcitons and plug ins. Learn how Jquery    and the Microsoft AJAX Library JavaScript libraries greatly simplify client side    development, and which to use for particular scenarios.</p>

          <p>    The Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) keeps showing up in an increasing number    of areas. Whether it is heard in the context of Prism, RIA Services, the MVC framework    or even Visual Studio 2010, MEF is mentioned as a core enabling technology. Some    people have even used MEF as an IoC container. In MEF everything is an extension    and everything is an extensible – including the extensions themselves. This introduction    is focused on describing what MEF is (and equally important - what it isn't), we'll    walk through a real-world scenario of changing an application to use MEF and get    a glimpse at how MEF will change how we think about application composition.</p>

          <p>    Javascript errors are nasty. All too often when a developer writes a web application,    they may write fantastic unit and functional tests, but forget that all-important    final layer of testing Javascript. Few enjoy debugging scripting errors, so we'll    take a look at how to use libraries like Screw.Unit, Smoke, JSpec, and JSocka to    help address those typos, errors, and even more dangerous design issues of "Doing    the wrong thing right."</p>

          <p>    Did you know Visual Studio 2008 comes with a code generator? Well it does, and you    should learn to use it so you can stop writing repetitive code (i.e. DTO's and DAL's)    and generate it. Come to this session to learn about the Text Template Transformation    Toolkit (T4). T4 allows you to use simple ASP.NET-like template syntax to generate    application source code, configuration files, stored procedures and more. This session    will give you all the information you need to start using T4 effectively in your    project, TODAY! We will go from basics (such as T4 template syntax) to advanced    topics (such as template design and use of T4 in large projects) stopping along    the way to create several templates from scratch.</p><p>    This will be a PowerPoint free presentation.
