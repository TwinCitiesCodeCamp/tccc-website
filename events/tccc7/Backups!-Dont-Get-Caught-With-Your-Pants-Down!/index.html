      <p>    Did you hear about the blog site that disappeared when their system failed and they    didn't have a backup to restore from? Or how about the pet supplier that went out    of business after a DELETE statement removed everything from their database and    there wasn't a backup on hand. These aren't urban myths but rather typical stories    that make the news every couple months. Is your company one database failure from    collapse? In this session, we'll go over the basis of backups. And also go over    the basics and best practices in creating a backup and recovery strategy.</p>
