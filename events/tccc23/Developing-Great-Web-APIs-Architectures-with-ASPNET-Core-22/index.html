      <p>You know you have to have a great experience when you develop your apps, right? The greatest experience for your user's centers around their data. That’s why developing a great set of Web APIs is so important. Using ASP.NET Core Web API is a modern cross-platform framework for the modern web. ASP.NET Core Web API can be run on Windows and Linux using all the modern web servers. The secret to it all is knowing how to architect your Web APIs for the best experience.</p>
<p>
Using the architecture in this talk allows your APIs specifically to work better due to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing a clear decoupling of the API endpoints, Data Access (Synthetic or Production) and finally the Data Domain classes.</li>
<li>The API Endpoints (Controllers) have no knowledge or responsibility of Data Domain and behind it Data Access.</li>
<li>Because of the decoupling and separation of responsibilities testing can be done easily and without issues.</li>
<li>Data Access segments of the architecture can easily be switched out without impacting the Domain or API Endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this architecture not only does the development story become easier but your end users get a much more stable API set to consume. The talk will explain and get you started on using these concepts with your ASP.NET Core 2.2 Web API solutions.</p>
