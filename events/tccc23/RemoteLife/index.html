          While the outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic is positive, we 
          unfortunately cannot host an event at Normandale Community College 
          in 2021. We're very hopeful that we should be able to get back on 
          track in April 2022 and finally have our TCCC24 event!

      In this talk, Mike will present several tips and techniques that he has learned over several years working remotely. We’ll cover what you can do when you have issues staying motivated because you are isolated physically from the rest of your team. We’ll review a few different kind of communication breakdowns and what you can do if you feel like a second rate employee of the company. We’ll also look at ways to foster a good remote relationship with your manager and co-workers.

Working remotely is culturally becoming a viable option more and more as time passes, increasing by 140% since 2005. There are great opportunities available to people that may feel stuck or restricted geographically. This presentation is aimed at giving you a headstart or boost in your remote life.
