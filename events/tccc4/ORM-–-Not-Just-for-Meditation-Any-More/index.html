      <p>    The "shape" of data in a relational database is not the same as the "shape" of data    in an object oriented application. That is as it should be; for both efficiency    and effectiveness, the goals for storing data are different from those of manipulating    it within the application. The question is how to bridge the inevitable gap between    the two environments. For an increasing number of projects, an Object Relational    Mapping (ORM) package is the answer. An ORM allows the developer (1) to declaratively    define a conceptual model of how the application wants to see the data, (2) to point    to an existing data store (e.g., a database), and (3) to define a mapping between    the conceptual and physical data. From this declarative model, the ORM generates    the code to move data back and forth between the application's view of the data    and the data store's view of the data. We will write several versions of a simple    (yet compelling) application using the new Entity Framework ORM package from Microsoft,    using NHiberate from the open source world, and using LLBGenPro from the non-Microsoft    commercial world. Comparing and contracting will take place. Look for a few "Top    Ten" lists about ORM: features to look for, reasons to use ORM, functionality other    than data mapping that ORM provides, and ORM practices to avoid.</p><p>Presentation Material</p><ul>    <li><a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/2008-Spring-Code-Camp.aspx">Code Drop</a></li>    <li><a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/The-PowerPoint-Deck-for-the-ORM-Talk.aspx">Slide Deck</a></li></ul>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Jon Stonecash is a Senior Consultant at Magenic. Jon Stonecash has worked in software    development for much longer than he would like to admit. In that time Jon has had    the opportunity to make most of the serious software development mistakes at least    once. He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has    survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about    databases and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business    logic. He is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development    process. Jon can be reached at jons@magenic.com.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li>        <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/default.aspx">            Personal Blog ("Designing            Out Loud in the .NET Space")        </a>    </li></ul></p>
