      Business Driven Development is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. BDD encompasses many of the same practices as Specification by Example, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), Example-Driven Development (EDD), and Story Test-Driven Development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customerâ€™s needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. This talk will focus on why we need to do BDD, How we can include BDD into our development process, the advantages and challenges in implementing BDD. Examples for this talk will be in .Net/SpecFlow. If you are a Developer, Tester, Business Analyst, Product Owner or a stakeholder in a software development project this talk will show you how you could build products with in-built quality and value and can be extended easily.
