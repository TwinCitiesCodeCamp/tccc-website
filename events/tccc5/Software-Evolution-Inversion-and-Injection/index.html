This continuing change cannot    happen if the software design and implementation is riddled with dependencies: A    change to module A triggers changes in B and C, that collectively, trigger more    changes in D, E, F, and G and so on until the software explodes. This sounds like    a terrific special-effects movie but a very bad information technology experience.    There are design practices that build "fire walls" that isolate one part of the    software from other parts, but ultimately the question becomes, how can one part    of the software invoke the services of another part without becoming dependent on    that other part? This sounds very much like a Zen riddle: "What is the sound of    one hand clapping?"</p><p>    Enter the twin concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. With Inversion    of Control, when a particular module of the software is dependent upon a particular    service, say logging, that dependency is abstracted down to an interface. Any invocation    of the logging function is made against the interface. Before the module can execute,    it must obtain a reference to an object that implements the interface. There are    a lot of ways to accomplish this: 1) passing the reference as a part of instantiating    or invoking the functions of the module, 2) returning the reference from a factory    method, and 3) injecting the dependency reference as part of a Dependency Injection    framework.</p><p>    We will look the design patterns for Inversion of Control and demonstrate code that    uses the following Dependency Injection frameworks:</p><ul>    <li>Castle Windsor</li>    <li>StructureMap</li>    <li>Unity</li>    <li>Spring.NET</li></ul>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Jon Stonecash is a Senior Consultant at Magenic. Jon Stonecash has worked in software    development for much longer than he would like to admit. In that time Jon has had    the opportunity to make most of the serious software development mistakes at least    once. He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has    survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about    databases and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business    logic. He is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development    process. Jon can be reached at jons@magenic.com.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li>        <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/default.aspx">            Personal Blog ("Designing            Out Loud in the .NET Space")        </a>    </li></ul></p>
