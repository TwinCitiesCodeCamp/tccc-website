        <p>
          While the outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic is positive, we 
          unfortunately cannot host an event at Normandale Community College 
          in 2021. We're very hopeful that we should be able to get back on 
          track in April 2023 and finally have our TCCC24 event!

They allow you to add further functionality    to the existing product which is the foundation of SharePoint Development. SharePoint    will not address all the requirements your business is looking for, but it does    allow for customized solutions in order to meet the needs of your business. SharePoint    Event receivers are not overly complicated, but there are several outlined steps    for deployment and usage that need to be taken into consideration, and are worth    exploring. In this workshop, I will cover:</p><p>    </p><ul>        <li>1) Function of Event Receivers</li>        <li>2) Definition Files (eg. Feature.xml)</li>        <li>3) Developing Assemblies</li>        <li>4) Deployment Strategies</li>        <li>5) Issues to be aware of</li>        <li>6) A Solution Example using Event Receivers</li>    </ul><p></p>
