          <p>    This presentation will compare three operating systems built around a managed (.NET)    kernel: Microsoft Singularity, SharpOS, and Cosmos. Singularity is an effort from    the Microsoft Research Group; Cosmos and SharpOS are open source kernels. All three    kernels are under development but already provide an insight into the future of    computer systems and design. This presentation will discuss the approaches behind    each kernel and then demonstrate how to compile and create applications for each.</p>

          <p>    LINQ is a great technology for accessing data and Silverlight opens the door to    a rich set of options for presenting information in your application. In this session    we'll look at how we can use these new technologies together to build a rich user    experience. From working with LINQ to pull information from a web service to building    the front end using the latest techniques with XAML you will get insight in how    to leverage these tools.</p>

Would you like to be able to generate custom documentation at the push of a button?    DocBook is a great tool for creating and maintaining documentation. DocBook allows    you to keep all of your documentation consistent and up to date with ease. DocBook    is "a schema (available in several languages including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs,    and W3C XML Schema) maintained by the DocBook Technical Committee of OASIS." In    this session we will show you how to set up a DocBook project and use it to its    full potential for you and your company. We will show you how to use the DocBook    build chain to produce custom documents to ship to your clients and use the same    files to build different documents for your developers.</p>

          <p>    Learn about aspect-oriented design patterns and how they can be used to quickly    add common functionality to your business objects. Aspect-oriented programming allows    for the separation of true business logic and the code written allowing interaction    with user interfaces. The Core framework is a generation model that dynamically    adds common services, such as logging, auditing, persistence, and security to business    objects. Aspects, or behaviors, are requested using attributes or configuration    files which allows services to be included only where necessary eliminating overly    bloated objects; tailored for the environment into which the object is loaded.</p>

This presentation is going    to go through Analysis Services in very simple terms so that first and foremost,    everyone comes away with a good understanding of what it is, what Analysis Services    does, and what you as the developer can do with it. If you have been frustrated    with attempting to understand the basics of Analysis Services, then this presentation    is for you!</p><p>    We will cover the following basic components of analysis services and what each    of them do: star schemas, dimensions, facts, measure groups, calculated measures,    aggregations, and more. We will also cover what the basic processing mechanisms    involved are for processing dimensions and measure groups. We will build a simple    cube and browse the cube, so you can see the how and the why. You will come away    from this presentation with a solid understanding of what Analysis Services is,    when you might want to use it, and how to manage it.</p>

Learn which current practices will need to change and how this    will affect your development techniques and your existing sites. Review tools that    will be built into the browser to help developers debug and create web pages. Web    Slices are a new feature that allow developers to mark areas of web pages that users    can subscribe to like RSS feeds to wach for updates to those slices.

Why code all the pages yourself when    you can use the ASP.NET Dynamic Data to build the initial pages based on your data    schema? This new feature creates the .aspx pages for you based on your data. The    pages can be used directly, or you can customize the pages to add your own look    and feel. You can augment the data model for the site to include information that    can automatically create the necessary validation controls! Included are a set of    Field Template controls that are user controls to edit particular types of data,    these can be customized once and apply to all page templates used on the site.

HLSL allows graphics programmers to create realistic graphics through the    use of a combination of math algorithms and the hardware they are processed on.    Around the time of DirectX 8, shaders were implemented to allow changes per geometric    shape, vertex, and pixel during a frame render. As one of the items comes to render    on the graphics device, the math algorithm written into the shader file is applied    to the respective object and is rendered to the screen. Current technology has reached    the point where shaders are a necessity for any graphics developer, considering    graphics libraries such as Microsoft's XNA have removed support for a non-programmed,    ‘fixed' graphics pipeline. A simple shader is built to emulate a point light while    each step includes reasoning behind the code and relevance to the theory of a point    light. A conclusion is given explaining other uses for shaders.</p>

          <p>    This talk assumes you know the basics of the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p><p>    Since ASP.NET MVC gets rid of Viewstate and the postback model, most existing server    controls aren't very useful for MVC related development. The ASP.Net MVC team has    built in a whole set of helper methods to accelerate building your views, but there    is more that can be done to make ui design more effective in the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p><p>    In the newer generation of browsers (Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3,    Opera 9 and Chrome .2) there has been significant improvements with JavaScript rendering    speed. This means that rendering controls on the client side is much more feasible    and efficient. We're going to leverage functionality and components from two different    JavaScript libraries (jQuery and YUI), to make our ASP.NET MVC websites more expressive    and functional.</p><p>    Most of the techniques used in this talk with YUI and jQuery could be used in Webforms    development with a little modification.</p>

This continuing change cannot    happen if the software design and implementation is riddled with dependencies: A    change to module A triggers changes in B and C, that collectively, trigger more    changes in D, E, F, and G and so on until the software explodes. This sounds like    a terrific special-effects movie but a very bad information technology experience.    There are design practices that build "fire walls" that isolate one part of the    software from other parts, but ultimately the question becomes, how can one part    of the software invoke the services of another part without becoming dependent on    that other part? This sounds very much like a Zen riddle: "What is the sound of    one hand clapping?"</p><p>    Enter the twin concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. With Inversion    of Control, when a particular module of the software is dependent upon a particular    service, say logging, that dependency is abstracted down to an interface. Any invocation    of the logging function is made against the interface. Before the module can execute,    it must obtain a reference to an object that implements the interface. There are    a lot of ways to accomplish this: 1) passing the reference as a part of instantiating    or invoking the functions of the module, 2) returning the reference from a factory    method, and 3) injecting the dependency reference as part of a Dependency Injection    framework.</p><p>    We will look the design patterns for Inversion of Control and demonstrate code that    uses the following Dependency Injection frameworks:</p><ul>    <li>Castle Windsor</li>    <li>StructureMap</li>    <li>Unity</li>    <li>Spring.NET</li></ul>

          <p>    This session will cover what XNA is (and isn't) along with what's needed to develop    with both XNA 2.0 and the 3.0 beta. We will also cover key differences between the    two versions along with the features and limitations of each. Target platforms of    Windows, XBOX 360 and Zune will be discussed. We'll go through some demos and take    a look at some code, identifying key aspects of the XNA Framework and game development.</p>
