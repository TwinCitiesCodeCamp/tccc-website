          While the outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic is positive, we 
          unfortunately cannot host an event at Normandale Community College 
          in 2021. We're very hopeful that we should be able to get back on 
          track in April 2023 and finally have our TCCC24 event!

      <p>    Need help understanding Analysis Services and would like to get a quick introduction    and basic understanding of what Analysis Services is? This presentation is going    to go through Analysis Services in very simple terms so that first and foremost,    everyone comes away with a good understanding of what it is, what Analysis Services    does, and what you as the developer can do with it. If you have been frustrated    with attempting to understand the basics of Analysis Services, then this presentation    is for you!</p><p>    We will cover the following basic components of analysis services and what each    of them do: star schemas, dimensions, facts, measure groups, calculated measures,    aggregations, and more. We will also cover what the basic processing mechanisms    involved are for processing dimensions and measure groups. We will build a simple    cube and browse the cube, so you can see the how and the why. You will come away    from this presentation with a solid understanding of what Analysis Services is,    when you might want to use it, and how to manage it.</p>
