          <p>    <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2009/04/19/Spring-2009-Code-Camp-Software-Solution.aspx" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    One definition of programming is the extraction of formal structure from unstructured    situations. The "real world" is chaotic. When we develop software, we abstract from    this messy maelstrom to build database tables and software objects that are, at    least relatively, more structured. But it is impossible to eliminate the mess. Anyone    who writes that part of the application that accepts data at the "edge" of the application    knows just how messy it can be. There are three ways that the application design    can respond to the data entry problem:</p><ul>    <li>        Reduce the complexity of the data entry by requiring the user to parse the data        into individual textboxes that are so simple as to be un-interesting. If you build        applications this way, turn your head away in shame. Stand tall and say, "I will        not make my users do work that the computer software can and should be doing."    </li>    <li>        Build logic to parse the mess and extract as much of the meaning from the maelstrom.        This is fun, interesting, and useful. There are several ways of doing this and each        way leads to lots of opportunities to show you some code.    </li>    <li>        Add structure under the covers by using "micro formats". Again, this is a good        thing that lends itself to more opportunities to show you some code.    </li></ul><p>    Just so you won't think parsing and micro formats are only for the "fancy folk",    we will look at parsing and micro formats to deal with common data entry items such    as addresses and phone numbers. These "ordinary data entry problems" can be very    difficult to solve in the general case. We will parse these items with regular expressions,    programmatic state machines, and formal parsers, noting the wonders and woes of    each approach. Once you have struggled with handing the entry of these items, you    should be motivated to make it easier for others by tagging your output using "micro    formats" that vastly reduce the effort for other programs to accept the output your    applications produce.</p>

Such examples include loading game menus through XML, generating 2D levels with    simple text files, and using other file formats to generate game levels, menus,    etc... The primary focus of this talk is to show implementations of code that pull    data from other sources to build simple games. Note, the specifics of XNA won't    be detailed in this discussion unless absolutely necessary.</p>

We look at some of the new features in Microsoft SQL Server 2008, including    data types for spatial data, and how we can use these features to build interesting    applications. We then take this functionality and expose it using a Windows Communication    Foundation (WCF) service. Finally, we explore the software development kit (SDK)    for Microsoft Virtual Earth and how we can build on top of this rich interactive    platform using new Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and JavaScripting capabilities    in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.</p>

Visual Studio developers have tremendous opportunities in this space. Why?    Developing for a Windows Mobile phone leverages your existing coding experience    and takes it to new heights. In this session, we'll look at some of the coolest    new devices, you'll learn how to set up Visual Studio with the latest SDK and device    emulators, and you'll see how to build, deploy and debug Windows Mobile applications.    We'll work with building a realistic application, working with data and finally    packaging it up.</p>

At its best, metaprogramming can    greatly improve productivity, as is the case with Grails, but at its worst it can    destroy expectations and induce versioning confusion. This talk introduces the myriad    metaprogramming techniques Groovy and dynamic typing allows, shows how some of them    are used in real life, and compares them to what's available in other languages.    Oh yeah, all code will be written live.</p>

While you should try to keep the presentation    layer independent from the UI technology and platform in order to improve testability,    it's not always easy to do. Design patterns can help. In this session I'll discuss    design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View Presenter (MVP)    for building presentation layers that can truly be used across multiple platforms,    including WPF, Silverlight and Windows Mobile, and in Software as a Service (SaaS)    scenarios.</p>

          <p>    With Visual Studio 2010, F# will officially become a first-class citizen in the    .NET development ecosystem. This session will explore functional programming, why    it matters in an object-oriented world, and how F# bridges the gap. I will also    discuss some lessons learned from using F# with OpenCV, an unmanaged computer vision    library.</p>

          <p>    This session will introduce you to the WPF Composite Application Library. Using    the Comp App Library, developers can quickly build a WPF application that can be    extended with customized UI modules, services, events, and more. We will take a    look at getting a Composite Application initialized, adding custom modules, building    views, and coordinating services and UI interactions using the CAL.</p>

          <p>    When you're using Shoes, programming is really fun again. Shoes is a simple yet    powerful application framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications.    In just a few lines of code, you can be pulling feeds from Twitter, and in a few    more, you can be grabbing videos from YouTube. Kids as young as five years old are    learning to program using Shoes because it's so easy and comfortable, but it's also    extremely flexible too. You can use it to check on the status of your servers or    as a frontend to pushing code into production. In this session, you'll learn about    the Shoes framework and see how easy it is to build something fun and useful.</p>

          <p>    With multi-core computers becoming commonplace, and technologies like Silverlight    requiring the use of asynchronous programming, and the use of distributed service-based    computing spreading, we are entering an era where parallel and concurrent programming    is virtually required. Are you ready to be multi-threaded? Parallel? Concurrent?    Are you ready to build applications that are not only parallel, but distributed?    This session will discuss the drivers of this change, the challenges we face, and    some of the solutions available today and in the near future on the Microsoft .NET    platform.</p>

          <p>    Have you been to Ruby on Rails talks and found the framework interesting? Do you    want to use Ruby on Rails for your next project but have to connect to a legacy    database and don't know if Rails will work? Rails' object relational mapping allows    to connect to legacy databases easily and use rails conventions to build your web    application, without disrupting the database. During this talk we will look at a    very hideous database (something that I hope no one will ever see) and build a simple    rails application on top of it. This demo will revolve around using SQL Server 2005.</p>

          <p>    With the addition of the new ASP.NET MVC framework there will be a lot of questions    surrounding how this technology can be used instead of the Web Forms that we all    have been used to since .NET 1.0. With the addition of the MVC Framework we now    have the best of the old world ASP Classic, with a compiled and easier to debug    workspace. This session will cover a quick overview of the MVC framework, and continue    with building a 'Real World' application. The message that will be carried from    within the session will be how the MVC Framework can be harnessed in future projects    within the attendee's future projects. This will be a "Must See" session for any    web developer looking to the future.</p>

          <p>    While most of us were looking at new features like Linq when C# 3.0 and VB9 came    out, behind the scenes, a much more interesting and powerful feature snuck in -    the ability to write programs that literally write themselves! In this session,    we explore how to write programs that write themselves using the classes in the    System.Linq.Expressions namespace. These classes allow you to evaluate code at runtime    and even write new code at runtime - without having to resort to IL generation (why    should Lisp hackers get all the fun?). You will learn how to use the classes in    the namespace, how they work together, as well as some examples of how such things    can be useful in ordinary line of business applications.</p>

But what about when we need to start building    full object graphs into our test in order to test an interaction or state? Yeah,    Houston, we have a problem. With mocks we can streamline development by mocking    out dependencies. Mocks will allow us to not only mock our dependencies but to also    test our interactions and state very easily.
