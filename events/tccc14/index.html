        <p>    This presentation seeks to eliminate that spaghettified, unmaintainable, untestable    mess that JavaScript is so famous for producing and turn it into something beautiful.    Developed after working on large teams with devs unfamiliar with JavaScript (not    to mention Backbone) and yet tasked to create with it, I will walk through the 9    tips that I've found in practice will make your BackboneJS implementation easily    maintained, easier to read, run better, and will allow you to effortlessly write    those ever-so-important unit tests. Heavy on code samples, best practices, anti    patterns, gotchyas, and random insights, this presentation is meant to serve as    a reference point for creating a beautiful Backbone implementation for apps of any    size and reduce the learning curve of BackboneJS. Prior experience working with    Backbone is recommended, but not strictly necessary.</p>

        <p>    Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you have likely read an article, seen a    talk, or read some noxious vendor's brochure hailing the coming "Big Data Revolution".    The hype has become so thick that anything that involves a database is being rebranded    "Big Data" in the same way that anything that involves the Internet has been rebranded    "Cloud".</p><p>    In this talk, we are going to separate the cool stuff from the malarkey. We will    cover:</p><ul>    <li>Big Data and Analytics - Why it Matters</li>    <li>What is a Data Scientist? - How are they different?</li>    <li>What kind of problems are solved using Analytics?</li>    <li>What are the boundaries? What kinds of things should not be called Analytics?</li>    <li>        What technologies are used? Do they involve functional programming? Hint: It isn't        just trendy Hadoop stuff...    </li>    <li>Real world examples from recent projects</li></ul><p>    By the end of this talk, you should be both:</p><ul>    <li>excited about analytics - what it can really do for you and your clients</li>    <li>        prepared to fight the battle between the hucksters who are out there rebranding        anything that remotely involves a database as big data - and the real thing that        can really drive business value    </li></ul>

        <p>    So you want to write a single page app eh? I’m not going to pretend that there aren’t    lots of frameworks out there to get the job done but something about Durandal.js    feels different – it’s simple, it runs on Knockout.js for MVVM goodness and importantly    you don’t have to write much code! FluentKnockoutHelpers builds on the power of    Knockout by using .NET and the Razor view engine to create ‘ASP.NET MVC like’ statically    typed helpers for use with Knockout. Utilize static typing, intellisense and the    compiler you already have in .NET to make Knockout development easier! In this presentation    expect to learn some pros and cons of SPAs including reasons to create a SPA in    the first place. After that we’ll dive right into the code of a non-trivial SPA    utilizing Durandal.js, Knockout.js, Require.js, Razor and WebAPI.</p>

        <p>    Today's users don't live on just a workstation or a laptop. With the proliferation    of laptops, smart phones, and tablets people work from a variety of forms and clients.    Building applications that can leverage a consistent view of identity, data and    services will enable the workforce to be productive wherever they are. In this session    we'll explore how to design and build applications that span the various device    forms and platforms using the tools and features of the Cloud that make it all possible    and easy.</p>

        <p>    Windows 8 introduced a new programming platform called the Windows Runtime (WinRT).    This platform is designed to support the development of “modern apps”, which are    defined by being very user-centric, having quality user experience and design, and    being integrated with cloud services such as push notifications. In this session    you’ll learn the basic flow of creating a WinRT app that integrates with the Windows    8 environment, as well as leveraging the powerful features available from the Microsoft    Azure cloud platform.</p>

        <p>    With each successive version, C# has added more and more keywords to do new and    (mostly) exciting things. Before you can use them, you need to know they exist.    From flagship language features like async and LINQ, to the subtleties of co- and    contravariant generic type parameters, we'll discuss every language keyword/operator    and provide some context for when you might see it in the wild or want to use it    yourself.</p>

        <p>    Using .NET Portable Libraries and the Dependency Injection pattern we will build    an application with versions that run on 3 distinct platforms (Win8, WP8 and the    Web), with the goal of achieving the greatest possible reuse across those platforms.    The techniques we use will minimize the code we have to create without having to    resort to the source-control trickery of the past. This session will be extremely    code focused as most of it will be spent in Visual Studio, creating code.</p>

        <p>    With the release of System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1, one of the major    focus areas has been increased ability to monitor .NET applications. If a company    is heavily invested in custom application development, monitoring and getting issues    quickly into the hands of developers is key to overall successful customer experience.    SCOM 2012 SP1 extends the reach of .NET application monitoring, and with the addition    of the Global Service Monitor, extends that reach outside the data center to the    cloud via Windows Azure. This presentation focuses on the .NET application monitoring    aspects of SCOM 2012 SP1 and shows the Global Service Monitor tool monitoring a    standard .NET application.</p>

        <p>    The increasing capabilities and performance of the web platform allow for more feature-rich    user experiences. How can JavaScript based applications utilize information security    and cryptography principles? This session will explore the current state of JavaScript    and Web Cryptography. We will review some basic concepts and definitions, discuss    the role of TLS/SSL, show some working examples that apply cryptography to real-world    use cases and take a peek at the upcoming W3C WebCryptoAPI. Code samples will use    CryptoJS in the browser and the Node.js Crypto module on the server. An extended    example will secure the popular TodoMVC project using PBKDF2 for key generation,    HMAC for data integrity and AES for encryption.</p>

        <p>    Mobile development used to be a niche development platform. Many of us shied away    from it due to unfamiliarity, lack of computing power, diversity of development    environments for different devices or because we scoffed at its insignificance.    Those of us who did are now behind the times. Mobile browsing will be the PRIMARY    browsing environment in the next couple of years and just about everybody has a    smart phone and/or tablet. The revolution is here and you must adapt. For the developer    that's been reluctant to make the switch, we'll be going over the low-hanging fruit    that's been developed in the last few years by people sharing your concerns that    will help you ease into the mobile development world including PhoneGap, jQuery    Mobile, mobile websites and responsive web design.</p>

        <p>    You've watched introduction videos and presentations, you've played with Web API,    and now you're considering it for a real-world project. In this session, we'll go    over multiple issues with using Web API "in the real world" including debugging,    IOC, custom routing, error handling, working with the client-side, versioning, anti-XSS    protection, async actions, authorization/authentication, and working with multiple    front-ends (Windows 8 and the web). This session is intended for those who are already    familiar with Web API, but everyone is welcome. Kamran will be using his own project    as an example, for better or worse, and would love for attendees to bring their    own experiences to the discussion. Code will be slung, questions will be raised,    and knowledge will be shared.</p>

        <p>    Developers usually leave documentation as a final step; one that they will get to    as soon as they are forced with threats of bodily harm. Writing the documentation    before writing the code, can lead to better code, better implementation and, of    course, actual documentation. This talk isn't just about philosophy. It covers actual    experiences and contains practical tips and solutions to get started. Discover how    easy it is to write down your ideas and iteratively develop the documentation. Learn    some of the tools to use to make your documentation look great. Find out that writing    things down doesn't have to be a chore, but can be liberating, and helpful when    working with non-technical people.</p>

        <p>    This is a talk about the similarities between Ruby and Haskell. It is also an introduction    to either; though you'd have to be familiar with the other! I'll show how you can    develop code in a cycle between testing, type checking, and refactoring that's reminiscent    of the "red, green, refactor" cycle. I will give some short code examples and then    develop a more interesting small/medium example. This is a focused version of a    series of blog articles that I've written: <a href="http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/12/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-1-testing" target="_blank">http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/12/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-1-testing</a>    (only one is currently published).</p>

        <p>    This talk, presented by See Sharp Guys, will provide real-world numbers from an    independent development team focusing on building applications for the last frontier    in app stores: the Windows 8 Store. The Google Play store has the largest install    base, and iOS undoubtedly generates the most revenues. But for developers looking    for a new opportunity, can the Windows 8 store offer opportunities the established    players can't? During this talk, we will demonstrate how it's still early days in    the Windows 8 store, and now is the time to get your app in the store and capitalize    on this new and growing market. We will cover what we have seen by having a top    10 app, a top 100 app, and a low-tier app in the store at the same time. During    the second portion of our talk, we will do a 'deep dive' and look at analytics of    user behavior inside mobile applications, what metrics drive revenues, and how you    can capture metrics in your app (whether on Windows, Android or iOS) to increase    your revenues too.</p>

        <p>    Do you often find yourself writing yet another Java web app while secretly, or not    so secretly, envying your co-workers who are playing with Ruby or Clojure with features    like closures that make it so much easier to express yourself? If the answer is    yes, perhaps you should be taking a look at Groovy. It sort of looks like Java,    acts like Java, and under the covers really is Java (i.e. it compiles to byte code)    so one could say it acts like a duck, talks like a duck, and therefore must be a    duck. So, what exactly is that duck? It is a language that - supports closures for    functional programming - can be either dynamically or statically typed (depending    on the preferences of the programmer or the context of the code) - has built in    mocking, which achieves great power through closures, while at the same time - looks    like and plays well with Java - interoperates with Spring - is understood by IntelliJ    Interested, come and chat about real life experiences of Groovy into Java code bases.</p>

        <p>    Windows 8 marks a complete shift in design principles for the Windows platform.    To stay relevant as a developer on the Windows platform, you have to learn to implement    the new Modern Design Principles. In this session, we will cover what you need to    know about what has changed and what hasn't. We will look at how you, the developer,    can leverage these design principles from the perspective you know best: the code.</p>

        <p>    Meteor is a full-stack app framework from the future. It breaks lots of rules and    puts the developer experience at the center, promising unparalleled development    speed. Bursting onto the scene in April of 2012 with an highly popular Hacker News    launch, Meteor has since been maturing at a fast clip, as the core team works hard    to vet the framework through lots of community feedback and real-world adoption.    Join us to get the lowdown on what Meteor is, what it isn't, and whether it lives    up to the hype.</p>

        <p>    Introduction to Grails. Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework    for the JVM. It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention    over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience.    I will live code an example grails application to show you fast and easy it can    be build web applications on the JVM. Grails has an excellent following in the Twin    Cities with companies like Bloom Health, Thompson Reuters, Target, Object Partners,    and SmartThings all using Grails and Minneapolis hosts gr8conf US which focuses    on groovy and related technologies.</p>

        <p>    Imagine mixing the easy syntax, powerful language features, and rapid development    of Ruby with the speed, power, and flexibility of the Java Virtual Machine? Ruby    and the JVM go together like chocolate and peanut butter, and you'll see some examples    in this tak. You'll see how to use Ruby to build simple command line tools that    work on all platforns, you'll learn how to make a GUI app using Ruby and SWING,    and you'll find out how to take a Ruby on Rails application, turn it into a WAR    file, and get it working on a Java web server. With JRuby, you can use the Ruby    language and tap into the rich, powerful, and stable Java ecosystem.</p>

        <p>    Does your application send users a text message when their order has been filled?    Can they place an order by sending you a text? Can you interactively ask a user    for pertinent information while they wait on hold for a support rep? Can you call    them back when a rep becomes available? Can a user speak with a sales person in    their browser if they have a question about a product on your web site? These are    just a few opportunities, beyond the LCD or touch screen, that you might be missing    to interface with your users. There are approximately 7 billion users on the global    telecom network. That's over twice as many as computers and smart phones combined.    Creating rich voice and SMS interfaces will allow you to reach more people and serve    your existing customers better than ever before. Twilio makes creating these "no-screen"    user interfaces incredibly easy. If you've created a web page before, you've already    got what it takes to create a phone or SMS interface with Twilio. In this session,    we will explore how and where to add telephony into an existing application using    the Twilio platform. After a high-level overview of Twilio, we will live code new    voice and SMS features into an existing web application. We'll demonstrate how developers    can receive and respond to text messages and voice calls, and how developers can    reach out to any of the ~7 billion users on the global telecom network at any time.    Finally, we will demonstrate how developers can turn any web browser, iDevice, or    Android device with a network connection into a VoIP telephone using Twilio Client.    Code examples will be primarily JavaScript and Ruby, but the core concepts will    be applicable to any server-side programming environment. No previous experience    with telecom or a particular web development framework will be assumed. Voice and    SMS are the next frontier of usability, and Twilio can help you blaze the trail.</p>

        <p>    Powershell is a robust scripting and automation tool created to perform administrative    tasks within Windows. While it initially focused heavily on system administration,    Powershell has become more integrated within our development world (Nuget, Azure,    etc). What is better? The fact that it is built entirely on the .Net Framework and    all its glory!</p><p>    This session will provide a brief introduction to Powershell and its concepts and    explore the following:</p><ul>    <li>Ways that a .Net developer can utilize Powershell</li>    <li>Syntax differences between Powershell and .Net</li>    <li>Developing custom Powershell Commands (Cmdlets) in C#</li>    <li>Integrating Powershell into your C# applications</li></ul>

        <p>    Let’s face it, devices and apps are going to become a crucial part of our everyday    life. Tickers, dashboards and real-time systems will become more ubiquitous and    stuffed full of data than we see today. The philosophy of the world wide web being    a medium for static data is almost non-existent, yet the infrastructure hasn’t changed    in years. In this talk, we will explore how Microsoft proposes to solve this issue    with SignalR, Azure Service Bus and ASP.NET MVC 3 to build a horizontally scalable    solution to a real-time internet problem.</p>

        <p>    No hoax, you can actually use jQuery Mobile to build responsive web designs for    desktop, mobile, and every device in between. In this session we will review each    new feature in jQuery Mobile 1.3 including responsive tables, responsive grids,    sliding panels, and more. In addition, you'll also see several new demos that I'll    be contributing to jQuery Mobile's Demo site. Lastly, we'll discuss performance    strategies, remote debugging techniques, and client-side MVC integration advantages.</p>

        <p>    Build it and they will come, right? Right?! As developers, it’s very easy for us    to fall into the trap of building products by adding feature after feature of what    we think users or customers may want in an application. Before you know it, you’ve    amassed a large amount of technical debt in an application where very few folks    use all the features or worse, no one buys. What if there was a tool you could use    to help keep you focused, validate your idea before writing a line of code and help    save you time and money? In this session, we’ll cover the basics of the Lean Startup    process and learning how to apply it to product development through using the Validation    Board.</p>

        <p>    Build extraordinary audio applications in JavaScript with audiolib.js. In this session    you'll learn how to turn your web browser into a mind-bending, cat-annoying, audio-producing    machine. Leave your HTML &lt;audio&gt; elements at home kids - in this presentation    we look at the API's that make digital audio synthesis possible with JavaScript.    Specifically, we will dive in to audiolib.js - an open source JavaScript library    that wraps browser-specific API's. We'll discover basics such as oscillators, LFO's,    samplers, and using effects like reverb and delay. We'll also dig in to more complex    topics such as envelopes, custom synth instruments, custom effects, and building    a sequencer in your browser.</p>

        <p>    Congratulations! You made it! The endless cups of coffee, the countless late nights,    the lines and lines and lines of code have put brought you to this moment. You're    ready to submit your app to the Windows 8 store. You're ready to hit submit. Wait!    Stop! Before you click that button, it might be a good idea to make sure you understand    the Windows Store certification process to make sure you don't encounter any publication    delays due to certification failures that could have been easily avoided. In this    session, you'll learn more about the end-to-end process to publish an app to the    Store, including monetization options, submission flow and best practices, and certification    tips and tricks. Even if you haven't started creating Windows Store applications    yet, this session will serve as a good foundation to help you start your journey,    and it will help you avoid many of the pitfalls that many first time developers    run into.</p>

        <p>    Service Bus has been known for several years as one of the capabilities only available    in Azure. There was also no complete engine to run persistent workflows for "cloud    scale". Aligned with the release of SharePoint 2013, Microsoft brought Service Bus    "OnPremise" and developed a new Workflow Engine that will drive many, if not most    future iterations of Microsoft products requiring any type of workflow or messaging.    Now everybody has access to those. Both technologies are available now free to use    in your own applications or solutions. This talk will introduce those to .NET Developers    and demo how to use them.</p>

        <p>    Ruby on Rails is a MVC framework for rapid website creation. I will be demoing how    to install Ruby on your machine, installing gems (library packages in Ruby), and    how to create and configure a very simple web app with Rails. The Ruby on Rails    way is "convention over configuration" so we will easily be up and running by the    end of the hour with a simple data driven web app. Once the app is ready to be published,    I will demo deploying it to a free Ruby on Rails hosting service!</p>
