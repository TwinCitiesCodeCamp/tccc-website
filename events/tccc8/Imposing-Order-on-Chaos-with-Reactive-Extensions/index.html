          While the outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic is positive, we 
          unfortunately cannot host an event at Normandale Community College 
          in 2021. We're very hopeful that we should be able to get back on 
          track in April 2022 and finally have our TCCC24 event!

      <p>    The world of computing is becoming more and more parallel. A lot of the computing    technology that we use is an attempt to hide the chaos of mouse and keyboard events,    messages, and other asynchronous events from our programs. The approaches used to    date have limited succeeded in part by limiting what can be done with parallel processes.    The Reactive Extensions in .NET allow the program logic to handle external events    as first class citizens. Programs can manipulate events using LINQ expressions.</p><p>    Take the example of example of handling a drag-and-drop operation from a source    region of the screen to target region. Without the Reactive Extension logic, this    might take dozens of lines of code to keep track of the state of operation and to    invoke the drop logic at the right time. With Reactive Extensions, you could handle    this in as little as one line of code.</p><p>    The Reactive Extensions are more than a shorthand for multiple lines of code; they    are a different mindset. They provide a way to "collect" events and route them to    the appropriate logic in a very simple way. The final bonus is that the Reactive    Extensions provide a way to de-couple the event source from the event consumer in    such a way that unit testing event handling is very simple and understandable.</p>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Jon Stonecash is a senior consultant at Magenic, a Microsoft Gold Partner consulting    company. Jon Stonecash has worked in software development for much longer than he    would like to admit. In that time Jon has had the opportunity to make most of the    serious software development mistakes at least once. He has programmed in over a    dozen languages including several different assembly languages, Fortran, COBOL,    SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has survived the structured programming    revolution and the object-oriented revolutions (having inexplicably missed out on    the sexual revolution). Jon's software development activities have included the    development of operating systems, scientific and engineering applications, and enterprise    systems. He has worked in every phase of software development from the initial specification    of requirements through to customer support. Along the way, he picked up a BS in    Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding something that he can be reasonably    good at. His long term interests center about databases and the aspects of the application    that handle data access and business logic. He is also interested in the tools and    processes that assist the development process. Jon can be reached at <a href="mailto:jons@magenic.com" target="_blank">jons@magenic.com</a>. Jon also has an active blog on "Designing    Out Loud in the .NET Space" at <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/default.aspx" target="_blank">http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/default.aspx</a>.</p>
