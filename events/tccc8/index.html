Hudson is an open-source CI platform that is easy to use and is has a management-friendly    interface. This session will walk through the capabilities of Hudson CI with the    NAnt build scripting engine and demo a basic build that performs the build, unit    tests, code complexity tests, and comment notes.</p>

Admittedly, it is pretty cool, but what if you want    to go past the slap-it-together demos everyone is doing on the Internet? What if    I want to tailor RIA Services for my specific needs? How do I minimize my data traffic    to keep my cloud computing costs as low as possible?</p><p>    In this session we will look under the hood for RIA Services and explore how to    manually manipulate RIA Services from code. How do I force one row in my RIA Services    bound datagrid to update, without refreshing the whole page? Where is the RIA Services    cache inside my Silverlight application? How can I access it, what if I want to    remove something from the cache? How can I control filtering from my code? How do    I implement security into my RIA Services? This session will cover these topics    and more.</p>

          <p>    Are you ready for another version of ASP.NET and Visual Studio? ASP.NET 4 provides    some major additions to AJAX with greater client support in the way of templates    and the DataView control for data binding. It also remedies several issues that    have existed since version 1.0, including control naming and controls that render    more standard compliant HTML. Dyanamic Data also has changes to make its features    available to all ASP.NET web sites. This release also focuses on easing deployment    issues with web packages and the ability to transform web.config files for deploying    to production servers.</p>

          <p>    When you start a software project and want to collaborate with others, setting up    the tools can be a project unto itself. If the needs of your project happen to match    up exactly with the rules and restrictions of existing open source project hosting    options: Codeplex, Sourceforge, Github, Google Code, etc., those can be a great    choice. However, setting up all of those services, on your own domain, is easier    than you think and can be done on $9/month web hosting while giving you complete    control with few restrictions. In this session, we'll set up git/svn, bug tracking,    project management, blogging, wiki, mailing lists and Jabber instant messenger for    a project on Dreamhost.</p>

          <p>    The world of computing is becoming more and more parallel. A lot of the computing    technology that we use is an attempt to hide the chaos of mouse and keyboard events,    messages, and other asynchronous events from our programs. The approaches used to    date have limited succeeded in part by limiting what can be done with parallel processes.    The Reactive Extensions in .NET allow the program logic to handle external events    as first class citizens. Programs can manipulate events using LINQ expressions.</p><p>    Take the example of example of handling a drag-and-drop operation from a source    region of the screen to target region. Without the Reactive Extension logic, this    might take dozens of lines of code to keep track of the state of operation and to    invoke the drop logic at the right time. With Reactive Extensions, you could handle    this in as little as one line of code.</p><p>    The Reactive Extensions are more than a shorthand for multiple lines of code; they    are a different mindset. They provide a way to "collect" events and route them to    the appropriate logic in a very simple way. The final bonus is that the Reactive    Extensions provide a way to de-couple the event source from the event consumer in    such a way that unit testing event handling is very simple and understandable.</p>

          <p>    ADO.NET 3.5's Entity Framework presents us with several new options for accessing    data within our application. EF can be used build applications against a conceptual    model that is mapped to the logic data model. The goal of this session is to provide    an overview of the components provided within the ADO.NET Entity Framework including    EntityClient, Entity SQL, Object Services, the Entity Data Model, and LINQ to Entities.    This session will explore these and other features and will provide several examples    of how to properly apply this technology to your own development project.</p>

          <p>    Come to this introductory talk where we take a look at a new CLR 4.0 feature that    is likely to significantly change the way we code in C#.</p><p>    Do you remember when generics were introduced in the .NET runtime 2.0? That was    the the biggest new feature in that version of the framework and it's almost 5 years    old. Time for a new runtime release with new and exciting features.</p><p>    In this talk, we focus on the only new feature in C# 4 that really matters — the    dynamic keyword. There are some new, amazing possibilities that, previously, were    only elegantly achievable with dynamic languages like JavaScript and Ruby. We will    touch on ways that using dynamic can change the way that you code, including things    like a true ActiveRecord pattern, Expando objects, and more.</p>

We will cover the architecture of the Android operating    system as well as some ins-and-outs of Android mobile development. Starting with    the basic install (Eclipse and Android SDK) an actual Android Application will be    created during this session that will be published to the Android Marketplace in    real time. A general understanding of the Java language is advised but not required.</p>

          <p>    Distributed source control systems have become popular in the last several years,    but they have just recently gained popularity in the .NET/Windows space. CodePlex,    Microsoft's open source code hosting website, recently added support for Mercurial    as an alternative to Team Foundation Server(TFS). This is an exciting change for    people wanting to take advantage of a distributed source control tool. In this talk    I'll introduce you to TortoiseHg which is a Windows shell tool for interacting with    Mercurial. We'll cover the basic command-line options like init, clone, push, pull,    log and status. Then we'll examine how to perform the same actions with hgtk commands,    which offer clean graphical interfaces to perform the same actions. In the second    part of the talk we'll look at how to use branching and merging well. And we'll    finish up by discussing what makes distributed source control different from centralized    systems like Subversion and how it can change your source control workflow.</p>

          <p>    Go is a brand-spanking-new systems language that Google released in November, 2009.    Every wonder how awesome C would be if it was garbage-collected, concurrent, and    didn't take a few weeks to compile? Wake up; it's here! We'll take a look at this    new language that steals some of the dynamic flexibility of Python and Ruby, the    performance of C, and a compile time that you'll miss if you blink.</p>

          <p>    As enterprise software development has evolved we have identified patterns and practices    that help us write more extensible and maintainable applications. Patterns with    the names of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control have emerged to simplify    the reuse of existing components and aide us in wiring together disparate components.    Frameworks have been built to support these patterns. This presentation will explain    the patterns and enable you to build your own custom framework or review existing    frameworks to meet your needs.</p>
