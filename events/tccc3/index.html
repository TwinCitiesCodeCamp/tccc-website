          <p>    Software testing has gained a lot of interest in the recent past. Similarly, determining    system capabilities has been something people increasingly care about. But how do    you truly know what your system's capabilities are? How do you know for instance,    that the result of a stress test are not just a fluke or isolated incident? How    can you make accurate and responsible predictions about scalability? A few mathematical    techniques collectively known as Statistical Process control can provide an excellent    mechanism for measuring system performance and resource usage. It provides a solid    theoretical framework so there's no more "Seems to me like it should do ______"    or "Well, to me it looks right..." Statistical Process control was the driving force    behind Toyota, Nissan and Honda's successes, as well as Sony, Nakamichi and many    other brands known for their quality. And it can be applied to virtually every aspect    of software. To use it, you need a pencil, piece of paper and a calculator, although    a copy of Excel makes it really simple. No expensive tools needed and no heavy learnign    curve.</p>

Windows Power shell has the widest range of any language    known. Quickly learn the basic concepts, it's a command line shell to write simple    adhoc scripts. Learn a bit more and use it to write rich sophisticated scripts to    manage production servers and the like. Taken even further, use it to write .Net    programs with the full power of the .Net frameworks.</p>

          <p>    Using .NET 3.0 and CSLA .NET, see how you can build a (small) application in an    hour. The resulting app will have a UI layer, business layer and data layer. The    WPF UI will be rich and interactive, but nearly code-less. The application will    include both n-tier and service-oriented features, and will leverage WF for back-end    processing.

In the Microsoft .NET Framework version 3.5, access to data is integrated    natively into the languages.

          <p>    There are two primary ways of doing code generation: one, using code generation    mechanisms such as "wizards" that someone else provides and, two, creating your    own code generation templates. Writing your own code generation templates is coding,    pure and simple (well perhaps not so simple). I am going to show you how to code    templates using XML/XSLT, CodeSmith, MyGeneration, and (maybe) Orcas Software Factories.    This will include a lot of code from templates that I have written (will write)    for generating CSLA applications. One of the problems in generating code is how    to extend the generated functionality. No matter how cleverly you code the code    generation templates, there will always be some functionality that makes more sense    to generate by hand. I will take a look at three different approaches to how to    add that functionality to the generated code: using partial classes, using inheritance,    and using delegates. Unit testing is one very important factor in wanting to extend    to extend the generated code. I will cover some ways to structure the code, generated    and hand-crafted, to support unit testing.</p>

          <p>    We've been hearing a lot about LINQ lately, the new data access technology in the    upcoming 3.5 version of .NET. We've heard how it can be used to easily access data    from a variety of sources like custom objects, SQL Server, web services, and XML.    This session focuses on how to use LINQ to quickly and intuitively query XML data.    We'll take a look at the new XML object model in the System.Xml.Linq namespace (XDocument,    XElement, etc.) and how it supports LINQ to XML. While most of our time will be    spent in C#, we will also examine the new "XML literals" language feature in VB.NET    and how it makes coding LINQ to XML even easier.</p>

          <p>    This presentation will show you the basics of using Microsoft Robotics Studio, Phidgets    USB control boards with an on board computer. We will cover using basic sensor available    and how to create an autonomous robot using sensor readings and visual input via    an everyday web cam. This presentation will also demonstrate using the System.Speech    API which allows your robot to do speech synthesis and speech recognition. <i>        <strong>            Warning:        </strong> Presenter in not responsible for bodily injuries due to explosions        or attacks on attendees named John Connor.    </i></p>

          <p>    ASP.NET 2.0 provides the ability to override control and page rendering in order    to tailor the output for specific browsers or provide new behaviors. One great use    of adapters is to use session storage for viewstate rather than a hidden client    field saving bandwidth and improving performance, which can be easily accomplished    with a custom page adapter. Learn how to use the siteMapPath control, but render    its output in a DropDownList to save screen space.

          <p>    Working with XAML, a new way of declaratively creating user interface elements,    the professional design tools and innovative technologies in Expression give you    the flexibility and freedom to bring your vision to reality - whether you are designing    standards-based Web sites, rich user experiences on the desktop, or managing digital    assets and content. In this session, we'll look at the products that make up Expression    Studio and how they are used together to make great user experiences a reality both    on the web and on the desktop. We'll dive deep into Expression Blend and Expression    Design to see how they can be used along with Visual Studio 2005 to deliver rich    interfaces based on Windows Presentation Foundation for online and offline scenarios.</p>

          <p>    Tired of trying to extract values from comma separated lists? Need a more efficient    way to handle flexible parameters? This session is intended to show the power in    SQL Server 2005 in relation to the XML data type. SQL Server has a number of methods    which make using XML simpler. This session will demonstrate the usage of the XML    data type methods in the real world that makes database development easier. This    session will also discuss performance implications and any issues discovered while    using these methods.</p>

We'll take a look at what TorqueX    (Garage Games) has to offer XNA game developers and we'll go through a quick game    (using one of the TorqueX starter kits.) Time permitting, we'll also talk about    some of the resource packs from Garage Games.</p>

          <p>    In this session, we'll start from Ground Zero and hit all the high points of Game    Development with XNA. We'll spend a few minutes on what you need to get everything    running along with where to find it. Then we'll talk about what XNA (&amp; XNA GSE)    is and is not! We'll cover Creator's Club, the 360 and finally we'll jump into some    code, talk about the game loop and dissect a working game. We'll also give away    an XNA book or two.</p>
