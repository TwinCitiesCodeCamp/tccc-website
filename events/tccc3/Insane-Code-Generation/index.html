      <p>    There are two primary ways of doing code generation: one, using code generation    mechanisms such as "wizards" that someone else provides and, two, creating your    own code generation templates. Writing your own code generation templates is coding,    pure and simple (well perhaps not so simple). I am going to show you how to code    templates using XML/XSLT, CodeSmith, MyGeneration, and (maybe) Orcas Software Factories.    This will include a lot of code from templates that I have written (will write)    for generating CSLA applications. One of the problems in generating code is how    to extend the generated functionality. No matter how cleverly you code the code    generation templates, there will always be some functionality that makes more sense    to generate by hand. I will take a look at three different approaches to how to    add that functionality to the generated code: using partial classes, using inheritance,    and using delegates. Unit testing is one very important factor in wanting to extend    to extend the generated code. I will cover some ways to structure the code, generated    and hand-crafted, to support unit testing.</p>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Jon Stonecash is a Senior Consultant at Magenic. Jon Stonecash has worked in software    development for much longer than he would like to admit. In that time Jon has had    the opportunity to make most of the serious software development mistakes at least    once. He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has    survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about    databases and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business    logic. He is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development    process.
