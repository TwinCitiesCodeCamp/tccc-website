        <p>    For the past year I've been working in an environment with over 30 agile development teams all working simultaneously on the same product/platform. This has been a new experience for me as I am used to working in environments where only a couple agile teams are working together at any given time (and usually those teams are pioneering the methodology at that company, working along side teams developing software using a waterfall methodology.) Working with so many different agile teams simultaneously has been a very enlightening experience. Most of the usual battles new agile teams face have been fought and won, and new and interesting challenges arise. Come to this session to learn how 30 team, with over 300 repos, all work together on the same product and release functionality independently of each other.</p>

        <p>    Who doesn’t want to get more done in less time?</p><p>    ASP.NET MVC gives us an excellent toolset for building web applications. Unfortunately, due to its rapid evolution, good documentation is hard to find. However, using some simple techniques, you can build user interface components that can speed up development while maintaining a clear separation of concerns. In this presentation, we’ll learn how to build custom controls, templates, and custom validation. Save time while creating cleaner code.</p>

        <p>    Continuous Delivery is a great way to reduce times in development cycles and deploy new features and enhancements faster. In this session, we will cover the build pipeline and all the different steps that are needed to automate a release cycle. We will review a simple website example and watch it from start to finish, covering configuration steps. Examples will be shown using Visual Studio, Git, Selenium, AppVeyor, Load Impact, Sauce Labs Continuous Integration, and Azure / Azure Powershell Management technologies for deployment.</p>

        <p>    Building Angular directives can be a challenging proposition, building reusable directives is even harder, and building ones that scale is a whole different beast.  We will walk you through building a Angular tree directive from scratch that handles tens of thousands of nodes while maintaining performance.  We will show you where the dragons live and how to skirt their lairs.  Included topics:  Avoiding digest cycle limitations, compilation and linking and why it matters to you, templating without using transclusion (for reasons we will discuss), and why all of this is going to get better for developers in Angular 2.0.</p>

        <p>    The mobile web continues to be a challenging place for developers and users alike. In this session, attendees will learn how to diagnose issues that occur in mobile browsers, with an emphasis on tooling and performance testing. This session isn’t aimed at experts, but at developers who know the foundations of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and want to learn how to tackle bugs on mobile browsers. We'll specifically look at performance in terms of networking, framerate, and, memory use.</p>

        <p>    This simple technique that every programmer should know can simplify certain types of problems tremendously, allowing us to find an optimal solution to difficult problems quickly and easily using a mathematical process called Dynamic Programming (not to be confused with Dynamic Languages or Functional Programming). In this session, we will run through examples of using this technique to solve several problems, both "on paper" and in code.</p>

        <p>    MongoDB is one of a number of “NoSQL” database servers that stores data as documents – represented in JSON – rather than the traditional columns/rows/tables model. It is designed to be very useful for certain use cases, but is a poor fit for others. In this presentation we will discuss what exactly MongoDB is, discuss what types of applications are appropriate for it and which types are not, and walk through the basics of installing, issuing queries and using indexes. No special experience is required but some familiarity with database concepts and JSON will be helpful.</p>

        <p>    Most developers want to be able to write better code in less time which is why tools like ReSharper are so popular. If you've been keeping up on the latest from the Microsoft developer front you've probably heard about the .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn"). Beyond having visibility into the inner workings of the compiler one of the main features is the set of code analysis APIs it provides. In this session we'll walk through using those APIs to create your own ReSharper-like code refactorings and code fixes using the latest CTP of Visual Studio 2015. With any luck you'll leave with some ideas on how you can use the .NET Compiler Platform to scratch a couple items off your own personal "I wish Visual Studio did this" list.</p>

        <p>    Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection. And it just hit 1.0.</p><p>    This presentation will provide an introduction to the Rust programming language, what it's good at, and why you might prefer it over C for your next project requiring low-level optimization. I'll also demonstrate using common C-style FFI mechanisms to call into functions written in Rust from other programming languages, like Python, Ruby, or Node.js.</p><p>    Rust is already being used in nontrivial, real-world projects. At Skylight (<a href="http://skylight.io" target="_blank">http://skylight.io</a>), Yehuda Katz is wrapping Rust inside a Ruby gem in order to profile Rails app performance with "low enough overhead that you can leave it always-on in production" (<a href="http://blog.skylight.io/our-new-featherweight-agent/" target="_blank">http://blog.skylight.io/our-new-featherweight-agent/</a>). At Mozilla Research, the Servo project (<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Design" target="_blank">https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Design</a>) is using Rust to "develop a new Web browser engine [...] that takes advantage of parallelism at many levels while eliminating common sources of bugs and security vulnerabilities associated with incorrect memory management and data races."</p>

        <p>    Web developers are told that hacks like resource inlining, domain sharding, and image spriting are best practices for improving website performance. But these hacks are just to work around the limitations of an aging protocol. Although HTTP/1.1 has served the world fairly well for the past 15 years, changes to the way in which we use the Internet have pushed this protocol beyond what it was designed to do. The HTTP/2 specification addresses many of these limitations, while also making better use of network resources. Topics to be discussed are HPACK header compression, multiplexing, server push, and security considerations. Basic knowledge of TCP and HTTP/1.1 is recommended.</p>

        <p>    Mentors are invaluable resources when you want to learn something. They help you ask the right questions, show you pitfalls and traps along the way, and generally make it easier to learn by letting you leverage their experience. This session will cover mentoring practices at The Nerdery from the perspective of the mentor and the person being mentored, our successes and failures, and how our practices have evolved over time. A small group activity will let each attendee contribute what has worked or not worked for them and form the basis of a round table discussion on best practices as a mentor/mentee.</p>

        <p>    Messaging systems are not new.  You may even be using one in some fashion already.  However, ask yourself the following questions.  Do you have scheduled jobs that require an IsSomething flag in your database?  Do you have tables that have more than 1 IsSomething Flag?  Do I have necessary duplicate data across my system?  How did you accomplish it?  Are my external processing tasks decoupled, scalable, or long running?  Are there pieces of my system that do not need to be real-time?  If you answered yes to any of these, this session is for you.</p><p>    This session will introduce you to the how and why of using a message queue.  We will not focus on the details of the messaging system, only the use of it.  Code demonstrations will be in C# using RabbitMQ as the messaging system.</p>

        <p>    If you've written Java code in the past few years, chances are you have come across Project Lombok. While there are many things that Lombok does that streamline Java code and development there are a few that make me want to pull my hair out. In this talk, I will go over a bit of how Lombok works and then delve into where I feel you should proceed with caution, and why.</p>

        <p>    Elixir mixes functional language power with friendly syntax, and it turns out to be a fantastic way to work with data. The Phoenix framework gives you the power to build realtime apps with the same ease that Ruby on Rails did for database-driven apps a decade ago. In this session you'll learn about the basics of Elixir and see how to build a realtime collaborative app with Phoenix and some JavaScript. Elixir and Phoenix represent one possible future for web development. See how you can put it in use today.</p>

But Facebook recently announced the launched of Reapp. Reapp is a way to build "hybrid apps, fast."</p><p>    When most people think of hybrid apps, they think of PhoneGap. Reapp is the React way of building hybrid apps. Reapp creates hybrid apps by binding React to a cross-platform UI kit.</p><p>    In this session, we'll briefly go over React - in case anybody has missed the fun to date - before diving into the nuts and bolts of how to build hybrid mobile apps with Reapp, as well as briefly comparing the experience to other cross-platform mobile technologies.</p>

        <p>    Creating HTML5 games and animated applications that run in any recent browser on any desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone requires planning and a few special techniques.  Topics covered are: Planning the scenes and interactions, designing the layout, detecting the device and window size, sizing the canvas, scaling the graphics, performing animations, responding to keyboard and mouse events on laptops and desktops, responding to touch events on tablets and smart phones, and completing the game with appropriate interactions. A simple “Keep Away” game will be used to demonstrate the techniques.</p>

        <p>    It's been awhile since the flood of build a blog in 15 minutes in Rails videos, presentation and blog posts have flooded the internet.  The barrier to entry in the Rails world has increased for the average developer over the last few years.  I'm going to bring back the kickstart approach to building Rails applications.  Here we are going to learn how to build a Rails app and deploy it in 60 minutes.  We'll talk about the application structure, build a sample application and deploy it (pending internet connectivity). We'll even approach some topics like unit testing and styling.</p>

        <p>    Imagine this… You’re developing an app using Xamarin and come across a whiz-bang, flashy Objective-C UI library on GitHub which would be a perfect fit. You know there’s a way to consume this library with Xamarin, but everything just looks so, so … strange.</p><p>    In this session we'll take the mystery out of binding and consuming these strange Objective-C libraries to C# and Xamarin.  First we’ll cover the idioms of Objective-C to get a feel for the land.  Then start to find our way around by mapping Obj-C to C#.  Finally, we’ll add the niceties of home by extending the functionality of the original library with a more C# approach.  By the end of this journey, binding Obj-C to C# will feel just like home!</p>

        <p>    Logging is an essential part of an application but for too long we've been stuck with log entries that are a string and a property bag which can be difficult to analyze and correlate with other log entries. It is too hard to create meaningful logs for complex distributed systems when we are stuck using old logging frameworks. The Serilog library for the .NET framework and its structured or semantic logs allow us to add more context to our logs, more easily correlate logs across systems and greatly ease our querying and exploration of errors based on events in the system and other log entries. Serilog is easy to integrate into existing applications and can help you provide the rich data that you are looking for at development time in and in production by abstracting your logging sinks away from how you create your messages. It has a clean and simple API and a healthy ecosystem of sinks for your application to log to so you'll still be able to meet your companies standards and help improve upon them. Let your logs make you happy for once.</p>

        <p>    In this talk I give an overview of several cutting-edge web development technologies. Rather than being general purpose programming languages, they focus solely on the task of developing for the web. These languages use DSLs to simplify the common tasks of writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interacting with the database. Also differing from many dynamic language web stacks, these languages employ static type systems which can catch many common errors early in the development cycle; saving on a lot of debugging time.</p><p>    The frameworks that I'll cover are: Opa, Ur/Web, and Elm. The talk will also cover some functional programming techniques that are in common use in the frameworks.</p><p>    I'll present several reasons why I think that web development is tending towards these sorts of technologies. Even if you don't find yourself using one of these in particular, you may well end up using the concepts that they contain.</p>

        <p>    Microsoft has enhanced the VS tooling to support the front end development standards. In this session, we will setup a web project and learn to utilize node, npm, grunt, gulp, sass and bower to get our website up and running. Never heard of those tools before? Don't worry. We will cover that too.</p>

        <p>    Web Essentials is an awesome extension for Visual Studio that adds incredible new features for web developers.  Vendor prefixes and visual feedback for browser support are two of many CSS related features.  Browser link creates a connection between a series of browsers and Visual Studio.  Changes in Visual Studio are immediately reflected in all connected browsers, and changes can be made directly in a browser and reflected in the source.  There are also a large number of enhancements to the HTML and JavaScript editors.  Web Essentials is a great way to get early access to great new features that may be eventually added to Visual Studio.</p>

In the process I’ll show lots of fashionable stuff like ASP.NET vNext, Azure, Node.js, Microservice Architectures, GitHub, and Docker Hub at such a superficial level that it will frustrate the people in the room who actually understand these technologies.

        <p>    Mobile apps are clearly here to stay. As developers, we’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go that promised a write-once and run-everywhere scenario. Xamarin has been around for a while and allowing developers to use a C# code base with native user interfaces. Last summer, Xamarin added support for the user interface under the brand of Xamarin Forms, which provides a XAML-like implementation for markup. This lets developers use C# and XAML to write mobile apps to target iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</p><p>    Come see what Xamarin.Forms can do for you, where it may fit it and the pros and cons of this type of cross platform mobile development. This will largely be demos, code and walk-throughs.</p>
