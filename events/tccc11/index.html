          <p>    Are you Hadoop curious? If so, this session is for you. Apache Hadoop and "big data"    are the hottest buzz words in the IT space. In this session, we will discuss the    Hadoop architecture and then dive right into working code examples to solve increasingly    complex problems. The problems we intend to tackle are word count, analytics, and    finally handling updates with no random write functionality. All attendees will    be given the code discussed in class and a downloadable virtual machine ready to    execute the code examples discussed in class.</p>

          <p>    OK, so you are aware what Apache Hadoop is, but you are struggling to understand    where and when it should be used? Is it a replacement for the database, part of    the "cloud", or useful for my problems? In this session we will briefly discuss    common Hadoop deployments both physical and virtual and then follow that up with    an in depth discussion of the code which implements two common use cases and one    unique use case. Learning by code, we will pick apart Data Warehouse Integration,    Cheap and Deep Storage, and Stitching Maps Together. All attendees will be given    the code discussed in class and a downloadable virtual machine ready to execute    the code examples discussed in class.</p>

We'll start by implementing    a service for error logging, and show how this service can be hosted in IIS, through    a windows service, and via AppHarbor. We'll focus on the methods that need to be    created, how to configure the service, and how to interact with the service. We'll    conclude by showing how to build a reusable library to easily implement server-side    ASP.Net and Winforms client interaction, as well as discuss using JQuery to interact    with the service on client-side web pages. Projects will be built in C#.net</p>

We'll use C# as our    language of choice during this session, however design patterns are language agnostic,    so any object-oriented programming language can implement these patterns. Design    patterns are very useful in your projects because they allow for more robust solutions    while minimizing the pain of maintenance and trouble-shooting, as well as minimizing    (eliminating?) repetitive code.</p>

          <p>    The .NET framework is perhaps the most extensible, and stable way to go about cross-platform    development. Unlike native languages, it offers a byte-code which can be JITted    to high-performance native code at runtime, and offers near-native speeds on various    platforms such as Windows Phone, Windows 98-Windows 7, Windows 8, and Linux. Although    the same byte-code can be run on all platforms, the difficulty is often finding    libraries that will work on all these platforms, without the need to re-write your    code for each one. In this session, I will be introducing a cross-platform library,    which works seamlessly across all these platforms, and can be used to write high-performance    games, and other 3D applications for all the platforms above. This project is currently    available as an open-source library on <a href="https://github.com/IDWMaster/3DAPI" target="_blank">Github</a>, and anyone is welcome to contribute to it.</p>

In this session, you'll see how you can use static analysis tools (like Code Analysis/FxCop)    to find all kinds of implementation issues before they show up in a release. You'll    also find out how to manage rule sets in Visual Studio, and find out how you can    create your own custom rules.</p>

          <p>    The MVVM design pattern quickly became the defacto approach for building WPF and    Silverlight applications. But, are you also using the MVVM Light Toolkit? The MVVM    LightToolkit helps to avoid memory leaks, creates safe property notifications, allows    for flexible eventing, and more. Most importantly, MVVM Light Toolkit is a small    resource that can be added to any existing project without requiring rearchitecture    of your existing code. In this session we will explore the benefits of using the    MVVM Light toolkit in your WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications.</p>

This talk    will show the practical side of Monads - how they can be used in everyday programming    tasks. A brief amount of time will be spent on what a Monad is and what it is not,    as well as what Monads already exist in the .NET framework. This talk will focus    on demonstrating an implementation of the Maybe monad in C#, Maybe&lt;T&gt;, and    specific examples on how it can be used in your projects.</p>

Exodata    takes this concept of decoupling providers from consumers and applies it to data    retrieval. An enhanced vocabulary for IoC in general will be introduced and numerous    code examples will be presented to explain what Exodata is, how it is implemented,    and practical ways that it can be used in real projects.</p>

          <p>    The REST service model has progressively gained industry wide exposure and WCF support    for it is no different, as it continues to inch toward becoming a first class service    model within the WCF environment. Web API is effectively the next WCF iteration    for REST support. While Web API offers a more comprehensive feature set on par with    SOAP based service models, upgrading from existing WCF REST model to the Web API    model is practically painless. The nearly ground up Web API service model intends    to bridge any remaining gaps when compared to its SOAP counterpart and push the    envelope. We'll introduce and explore the API in some detail with discussions, demos,    and samples.</p>

          <p>    Microsoft recently announced Version 2.2 of the venerable SMB network file system    protocol. Features of SMB2.2 include multipath support, cluster capabilities, distributed    caching, and SMB over RDMA--cool stuff. How will these advanced features impact    the storage market, and what jobs are likely to be created? How will the Samba Team--which    was at one point ahead of Microsoft in clustering features--respond? Most of all,    what does SMB2.2 actually look like on the wire and how do coders break into the    illusive SMB/CIFS/SMB2 development community?</p>

Here's your chance to learn how    to build a motion detection application yourself. Using the Native Extensions for    Silverlight and Silverlight Out Of Browser we will build a program that will utilize    features of Windows 7 to let you know when motion was detected. As an added bonus    we will go over porting the application to Windows Phone 7 Mango taking advantage    of the new raw camera access.</p>

          <p>    "When will it be done?" is the question most dreaded by software developers. You    may think the most important tools for creating software estimates area crystal    ball and a divining rod, but there is a better way that won't involve magic. Plus,    accurate software development estimates can enhance your professional image in your    organization, and make life better by eliminating the mad dash at the end of the    project. This session will improve your estimating accuracy by teaching you several    techniques that I've learned through my 16+ years as a software consultant. It will    also show you how to handle situations where an accurate estimate isn't possible.</p>

This session is targeted at application developers who wish improve    their understanding of database performance and how applications interact with the    database. This session will target SQL Server, though the concepts are applicable    to most large scale enterprise databases. This session will focus on how to query    SQL Server's Dynamic Management Views (DMV's) to identify the performance bottlenecks    in an application. It will also cover how to interpret how the database is processing    your queries and how to tune your queries to run faster. Finally, I'll cover some    of the most common database performance issues encountered by application teams    and discuss some strategies for addressing them.</p>

          <p>    Javascript has been one of the most hated languages of modern times, but the emergence    of ajax has forced people to *gasp* actually learn the language. I'll talk about    the history of javascript from it's origins to the present and review the parts    of javascript that have allowed many developers to call a truce in the javascript    hate war and use it for serious web development. We'll focus on prototypical inheritance    and Javascript's features derived from functional programming models. At the end,    we will look at one terrible peice of code and transform it into something much    better.</p>

          <p>    With the advent of HTML5 modern browsers can create advanced graphics on a web page.    The &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;svg&gt; tags allow the web page to create sophisticated    charts and diagrams. These images are more than just pretty pictures. It is possible    to allow the user to interact with these images and to have these interactions affect    the more traditional elements of the web page such as form, input and control elements.    This presentation explores the possibilities and the mechanisms for integrating    interactive images into line of business web applications, using the canvas and    SVG elements plus a liberal dose of jQuery and JavaScript. The framework for demonstrating    these techniques will be ASP.NET MVC but the material can be used in any web server    technology.</p>
