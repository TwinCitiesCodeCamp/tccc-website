      <p>    Seemingly overnight, Ajax has gone from an obscure acronym to, well, having conferences    devoted to it. People are often surprised when they learn that Ajax isn't really    anything new - so if it's yesterday's technology, why all the hype? This talk will    examine the course of events that led up to the current love affair with richer    client applications. We'll talk examine the technologies that power an Ajax application    and discuss how to work with them - and then we'll examine a number of frameworks    that will do much of the heavy lifting for us!</p><p>    Once we understand the techniques of Ajax, we'll touch on where (and where not)    it's appropriate for your application finishing off with some common gotchas.</p>

    <h5>About the Author</h5>
    <p>    Nathaniel T. Schutta is a senior software engineer in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota    with extensive experience developing Java Enterprise Editionâ€“based Web applications.    He graduated from St. John's University (MN) with a degree in Computer Science and    has a master's of science degree in software engineering from the University of    Minnesota. For the last several years, he has focused on user interface design.    A long-time member of the Association for Computing Machinery's Computer-Human Interaction    Special Interest Group, Nathaniel believes that if the user can't figure out your    application, then you've done something wrong. Along with his user interface work,    Nathaniel is the cocreator of the open-source Taconite framework, has contributed    to two corporate Java frameworks, has developed training material, and has led several    study groups. During the brief moments of warm weather found in his home state of    Minnesota, he spends as much time on the golf course as his wife will tolerate.    He's currently exploring Ruby, Rails, and (after recently making the switch) Mac    OS X. Nathaniel is the coauthor of the bestselling book, Foundations of Ajax.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li><a href="http://www.ntschutta.com/jat/">Personal Blog</a></li></ul></p>
