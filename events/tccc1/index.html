No longer having to worry about deleting pointers,    leaking memory, having enough space available, it is all taken care of for you by    the Garbage Collector. But what happens when a large amount of your data is large    enough that it needs to go into the large object heap. How do you make sure that    you are not fragmenting it so much that the next request to get data has space?    How do you make sure that these large pieces of data are not mapped into the address    space all the time, taking up valuable space in the 2GB limit?</p><p>    This presentation will focus on some specific functionality that Thomson-West implemented    to handle large legal documents (MB of XML), that can be slow to retrieve via soap    in a manner that kept them out of the large object heap. Discussion will center    on implementing a soap extension that generically parses a soap response to pull    out the large strings, pushing them to the Virtual Heap, instead of placing them    on the large object heap.</p>

          <p>    Representational State Transfer or REST has gained a lot of mind share as an alternative    to SOAP-based web services. REST describes a resource-based architecture that mirrors    the web. "It's just XML over HTTP" is a common refrain. But as you did deeper, REST    becomes more complicated. Debates about the "right" and "wrong" ways to do REST    get hot and heavy fast. What are the advantages and disadvantages of REST? Who's    doing REST right and who's doing it wrong? We'll cut through the chaff, and show    you how you can use REST in your web services.</p>

In this presentation we will discuss how to best use    SSIS to create high performance ETL processes. Documentation on SSIS performance    considerations is not easy to come by, so in this presentation we will go through    the major issues that you need to be aware of and plan for when high performance    is a must. We will look at the actual performance differences using varying SSIS    data transformations and other SSIS settings. You will come away with numerous techniques    which will allow you to implement fast high volume data transformations.</p>

There are now over seven implementations of Ruby for all the major VMs and several    other platforms. JRuby is a 100% Java implementation of Ruby targetting the JVM,    designed to enable Java developers to use Ruby as a first-class language and also    to enable Ruby developers a powerful drop-in replacement for the standard C-based    interpreter. JRuby has made great progress toward matching Ruby in compatibility    and performance, and already can run popular applications like Rails. This session    will give an introduction to JRuby, JRuby on Rails, and what the future holds for    Ruby on the JVM.</p>

The good news for    web service developers is that the WCF team has put a great deal of work baking    security into the framework so you don't have to be a security expert to "get security    right".

We've heard about it,    dabbled in it, and might have considered using it in some our solutions… but one    of the hesitations comes from integration. How will it work with existing data?    How will it work with existing .NET applications and libraries? The answers are    out there ... and this discussion will lead you to examples on how you can do integration    (both ways) between Ruby on Rails and .Net. You'll see how you can easily invoke    / publish web services, databases, and libraries between the two.

People are often surprised when they learn that Ajax isn't really    anything new - so if it's yesterday's technology, why all the hype? This talk will    examine the course of events that led up to the current love affair with richer    client applications. We'll talk examine the technologies that power an Ajax application    and discuss how to work with them - and then we'll examine a number of frameworks    that will do much of the heavy lifting for us!</p><p>    Once we understand the techniques of Ajax, we'll touch on where (and where not)    it's appropriate for your application finishing off with some common gotchas.</p>
