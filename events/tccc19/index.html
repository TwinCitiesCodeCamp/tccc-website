          <p>	Come explore Elm,  a functional programming language for making web things. Elm aims to solve some of the same problems that Ember, React, and Angular 2 solve, but in a radically different way. Strong and static typing ensures that data you pass around in your apps really is what you think it is. A simple and tried-and-true architecture makes it easy to understand, and great tooling makes it fun to use.</p><p>	In this talk, we'll explore how we use Elm to build our user interface and our code, and we'll take an honest look at where Elm can make a difference for you, and where it falls short. By the end of the talk, you'll know how to get started and have all the resources you need to explore Elm on your own.</p>

          <p>	Documentation generated from source code is very popular. Solutions such as Swagger are available for many different languages and frameworks. However, limitations of annotation based tools are becoming apparent. An overwhelming number of documentation annotations make for great docs but muddy the source code. Then, something changes and the docs are out of date again.</p><p>	That is where test-driven approaches come in.</p><p>	Test-driven documentation solutions, such as Spring Rest Docs, generate example snippets for requests and responses from tests ensuring both code coverage and accurate documentation. It can even fail the build when documentation becomes out of date. This session will walk through how to implement test-driven documentation solutions for groovy ecosystem technologies like Spring Boot and Grails. Attendees should have a basic understanding of AsciiDoc and how to construct RESTful APIs in Spring Boot and/or Grails.</p>

Yet we often ignore many security concerns as we work towards our various delivery deadlines, handling only those that are easy to incorporate. And we generally rely on manual processes to ensure that even these steps are followed.</p><p>	Similar to what we are doing with increasing frequency for functional testing, configuration, and deployment, we can integrate some security measures into our pipelines and other processes.</p><p>	This talk will go through a few options, using examples for multiple programming languages including C#, Java, and Ruby and highlighting how running them regular could thwart various security threats.</p>

          <p>	Is CSS and layout a mystery to you? When you read HTML are you able to understand what will be displayed without constantly looking up classes or documentation? If you’re like me, these are problems you run into when doing the view layer of your application. CSS classes become meaningless combinations of letters that don’t really seem to express intent.</p><p>	However, there’s a library to help with that. Semantic UI is a framework that aims to create rich UIs “using human-friendly HTML.”  Gone are the days of col-md-3.  Instead, our HTML will have classes like “three column wide”. But it’s more than that. Semantic UI has a wide variety of elements, collections, and views that can make any application pop, all while following sane patterns.</p><p>	Throughout this talk, we’ll look at several key UI components, and talk about the underlying principles of Semantic UI. After leaving the talk, you’ll be bale to install Semantic UI (hint: it’s really simple) and get up and running on your next project.</p>

Then we'll apply basic animation techniques using the freely available Blender (<a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">https://www.blender.org/</a>) software package and finish it up by getting that art up and running in a scene within Unity (<a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/</a>).</p>

          <p>	Do you want to learn how to automatically generate strongly-typed Angular services for your Web API? What about Knockout view models that stay synced with your server-side code? In this session, we will walk through a sample application that leverages TypeScript, Angular2, and ASP.NET MVC/Web API. You will learn how TypeScript can help augment your development experience and your existing knowledge as a Javascript developer by adding type safety, OO concepts, and ES6 features to your codebase. If you consider yourself a C# or .NET developer and do Javascript on the side, TypeScript is a great fit for all the paradigms you're used to. If you work in a Linux or Mac world, you’ll still be able to leverage TypeScript with cross-platform tooling. Come and learn something that might help you become more productive and make your applications more robust and less scary to refactor. The speaker recommends watching his previous <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/presentations/tree/master/demystifying-typescript" target="_blank">TypeScript Demystified</a> talk for a grounding in the concepts of TypeScript but it’s not required.</p>

          <p>	React is a JavaScript framework that makes a radical departure from the MV* frameworks that have been inundating the development space for the last several years. With this radically new approach comes a pattern to replace the common paradigm of two-way data-binding MV* frameworks. This pattern is known as "Flux." While React has been gaining steam for a couple of years now, the Flux pattern is still a relative mystery to most of us.</p><p>	In this talk, we'll start with a quick recap of React to get everybody up to speed. Then we'll dive into the nuts and bolts of the Flux pattern, investigate some of the more popular Flux frameworks and make sure you walk away fully understanding this enigma.</p>

          <p>	Microsoft new cross-platform ASP.NET framework promises to appease those seeking modularization and performance improvements. Out with the kitchen sink that is the System.Web assembly, and in with the new. Couple this with a lightweight, cross-platform code editor which comprehends ASP.NET Core 1.0, and developers around the world rejoice. So let’s dive in! Open Visual Studio Code, and choose File -&gt; New -&gt; Project, right? Not quite!</p><p>	This talk will explore how to get started with ASP.NET Core 1.0, from the ground up, using Visual Studio Code. Along the way, we’ll discuss new features and how to take advantage of them in your applications.</p>

          <p>	Agile is all about the continuous cycle of development and feedback solicitation but mobile platforms introduce added complexity: how do you get your app out to all your testers or stakeholders across all the platforms so they can give you the feedback you need to refine it? In this session we’ll explore one way to do this across all the major platforms: Windows 10, iOS, and Android and throw in cross-platform Continuous Integration to boot!</p>

          <p>	As the user experience becomes more important, real-time push notifications are an important tool for web developers to master. Learn how to build real-time server-to-client and client-to-server push services in ASP.NET using SignalR. SignalR makes it incredibly simple to build communication hubs for real-time notifications, peer-to-peer collaboration, and real-time content delivery. SignalR is flexible, extensible and scalable. We will cover setting up a complete MVC5 application using both the Javascript client API and the .NET client. There are several transport protocols available depending on which server and client platforms you are using. We will discuss these options as well as extending, scaling and customizing SignalR.</p>

Platform as a Service (PaaS) has come a long way as well, and with the latest incarnation of Application Services (which includes Web, Mobile, API and Logic Apps) a developer is able to quickly and efficiently use the cloud to deliver solutions faster than ever. Microsoft Azure has changed a lot since it was released and in this talk we'll show you some great new compelling features that make all the difference.</p>

The Web Speech API can enable a voice interface by adding both Speech Synthesis (Text to Speech) and Speech Recognition (Speech to Text) functionality.</p><p>	This session will introduce the core concepts of Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition.  We will evaluate the current browser support and review alternative options.  See the JavaScript code and UX design considerations required to add a speech interface to your web application.

          <p>	Three years ago, Mozilla began experimenting with a low-level subset of JavaScript that supported ahead-of-time compilation and eliminated garbage collection pauses. The experiment worked: Programs written in C and compiled to this intermediate language, called asm.js, could deliver runtime performance within 1.5x of their native C speed. In contrast to Google's Native Client (NaCl / PNaCl) projects, asm.js remained backwards compatible with existing JavaScript engines.</p><p>	Clearly, there was room for performance improvement on the Web, and a way to get there without breaking old browsers.</p><p>	Last year, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla formed a W3C Community Group to collaborate "on a new, portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web." They called it WebAssembly, and it starts landing in browsers this year.</p><p>	Suddenly, JS isn't the only game in town: programs will be written in C, compiled to WebAssembly, and run faster than JavaScript ever could. Is this the end? Do we all have to learn C? Come to the talk and find out!</p>

          <p>	In today's world it has become virtually impossible to write software without using open source tools, libraries, or frameworks. Even if you avoid "third party" open source components, Microsoft is open sourcing more and more of .NET itself that it is inescapable. So should you be worried? Didn't Steve Ballmer tell us open source was bad and dangerous? Well, there are things you should know about open source in terms of licensing, maintainability, support. Many are things you need to think about when using ANY code you didn't write yourself, whether open source or not. By the end of this session you'll understand where open source does and doesn't differ from traditional proprietary tools, libraries, and frameworks. You might still be worried, but you'll understand WHY you are worried.</p>

          <p>	Solving problems that have more than one possible solution is something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization techniques can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions.</p><p>	In this introduction to mathematical optimization designed specifically for software developers, we will explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and add several of these methods to your toolbox so that you can put them to work for your customers. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math.</p>

          <p>	Integration is a key piece of modern software development. Whether integrating with external vendors or providing APIs for front-end technologies like AngularJS, REST has become the standard. This session will cover the basic principles of REST, how to create RESTful APIs in Grails, and end with a comparison of some of the plugins available.</p>

          <p>	DevOps aims to remove hurdles from getting features deployed to production by standardizing and automating the delivery pipeline, and Agile processes aim to make the act of development itself more efficient and incremental.</p><p>	The session will begin with a short intro to Release Management followed by an end to end demo of deploying and testing an ASP.NET 5, MVC 6 application in a Docker container to a Linux machine in Azure using Release Management online. We will be using the latest Build and Release Management UI from Visual Studio Team Services and Release Management Online.  Attend this session so you can understand how things are changing and what tools are available to help you keep pace with the developer evolution.</p>

          <p>	Business Driven Development is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. BDD encompasses many of the same practices as Specification by Example, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), Example-Driven Development (EDD), and Story Test-Driven Development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer’s needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. This talk will focus on why we need to do BDD, How we can include BDD into our development process, the advantages and challenges in implementing BDD. Examples for this talk will be in .Net/SpecFlow. If you are a Developer, Tester, Business Analyst, Product Owner or a stakeholder in a software development project this talk will show you how you could build products with in-built quality and value and can be extended easily.</p>
